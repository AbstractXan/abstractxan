  A detour to Shimizu
    % blog/shimizu_11.jpg
    & It's 8h00 pm on a cold dark winter night, we are outside of Shimizu harbor motoring in circles and waiting for a response from Shimizu Port Control. The temperature is 4C, the wind is blowing hard and our clothes are wet and caked with salt. We’re tired and hungry, waiting for permission to enter the Port. Prior to this, we just had a very, very rough 4 day passage, riding under 30-40 knot winds on the nose. This passage was a true test of strength, for us and for {Pino(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/boat/4733784360484864/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534132049)}, but first let’s go back and see exactly what happened…
    % blog/shimizu_13.jpg
    & We'd planned to go to Wakayama, riding on the back of a passing low with winds from the NE, shifting to the S and then to the SW, but the wind decided to turn earlier making it impossible for us to go east. We found ourselves close-reaching in 40 knot winds, heading straight north. Looking at the weather we could see that it would blow from the W for 3-4 days, so we made a new plan to head to Omaezaki. We'd read of other sailors taking refuge there in big weather and thought it would be possible to go, but again, the wind kept pushing us further and further east. The next port on our list was Shimizu, tucked in deep into the bay. We were able to point Pino to the cape just past Shimizu, but we weren't sure if again the wind and current would allow us to make some easting. 
    & At that point both of us were frozen solid. Wave after wave splashed over the boat and into the cockpit. The starboard rail was constantly submerged, our starboard side lee cloth was gone and the diesel bins were threatening to fall overboard. We had 3 reefs in our main, but 5 slides had snapped off (yet again), I wondered when the rest would break. If we lost the use of our main going forward would be impossible. 
    & Inside the cabin was also chaos. The joker valve of our toilet decided to stop working. Problems, we've learned, always come in pairs. Toilet water kept backflowing and because we were on a starboard tack — the toilet being on the high side — it all came spilling on the floor. We learned then too that the drain on the floor facing the toilet was clogged, so the toilet water began to accumulate there and the smell was horrid. We did close the toilet inlet valve, but the pipe is long and keeps a surprisingly large amount of water. The dorads too were leaking badly, we put the covers on and even flipped them around but water still came leaking out. Water is patient, if there's a crack it'll find its way in. 
    & We couldn't stand inside the boat because of the extreme tilt. The floor was slippery, wet with salt water. Doing anything inside required much care. There was no comfortable place to be, aside from a settee where we slept. The lee cloth kept us from falling out. Although eventually water began to trickle down onto our warm cocoon from the ceiling. Alas, our last stronghold against the wetness had been breached.
    % blog/shimizu_24.jpg
    & We were both tired physically and mentally. We had no appetite, the smell of toilet didn't help.
    & We were in Sparta mode. 
    & Both of us were scared we wouldn't make it. What if we couldn't make it to Shimizu? The port of Shimoda was next... but what if the wind didn't allow us to go there either? I imagined us getting pushed further and further east, past Shimoda, past Yokohama... and Tokyo. I wanted to believe we'd make it, but the last few days had been so horrible that it was hard to believe that things could be good again. 
    - "This whole sailing to Japan thing was a silly dream wasn't it? Why the hell did we think we could do this." 
    & I wondered.
    - "Pino, we're so sorry to have put you in this situation, you deserve better."

    & We were aiming for the point just east of Shimizu, with the blind hope of somehow being able to make some easting to get some shelter from the waves inside of the bay. The worse was yet to come, another danger lay ahead: a very busy shipping channel with cargo ships, fishing boats and other large vessels thundering up and down the coast at 10-15 knots. We had to cut through it to get to Shimizu. I swallowed hard, took a look at AIS to see if this was possible. We could see every ship, as well as their speed and if whether or not we were on a collision course. Our AIS alarm started beeping, signalling ships that are dangerously close, it did not stop beeping for many hours. 
    % blog/shimizu_16.jpg
    & This felt like the scene in Gattaca, when a myopic Jerome has to cross a busy highway without being able to see. Jerome jumped into the traffic and somehow made it out alive. That is what it felt like to cross that shipping lane. Some cargo ships altered course for us, but not all would, or could do this. Devine was driving while I stared at the AIS screen, trying to work us through it all, lying to myself saying that everything was going to be okay. I was counting the number of nautical miles to go before we were in the clear. At that point I was also afraid that the mountains around us would cause the wind to change direction, we were close-reaching and barely making it inside the bay, if the wind had too much north in it we’d be pushed further east still and we’d miss our target.

    & Instead of the wind shifting north it eased to the W again and permitted us to sail into the bay. We thought we’d be shielded from the waves in there, but the bay was very open and we were still getting pounded. Devine & I took turns at the tiller, whenever we got too cold to drive we’d switch places. We didn't feel great then, but something was helping us along, making us feel better and giving us hope. That thing was the sight of Mount Fuji, rising majestically in the distance.
    % blog/shimizu_15.jpg

    & The port of Shimizu was 20 NM from the bay entrance, we were doing good speed but it didn’t seem like we’d arrive before sunset. The sun eventually slipped below the horizon, just as we were getting near the port entrance. We were planning on getting into the breakwater and to find a place to dock, any place, and to alert the authorities of our arrival in the morning. I didn't have the contact info for this port but was confident that they wouldn't have a problem with us being here, considering this was a force majeure. I knew there was a marina in there, I had a rough idea of its layout as well as coordinates of a safe dock. That was my plan, to work our way onto that spot. At this point we just wanted to have a foot on land, to be in a safe place. When we got near the breakwater we rolled in the jib and started the engine. Just as we were coming in, we heard a call on the radio...
    - “Pino, Pino, this is Shimizu port radio.”
    & This was our first time in a big Japanese port, we didn't expect anyone to hail us.
    - “This is Pino.”
    - “What is your intention Pino.”
    - “We are going to Shimizu marina.”
    - “Do you have a local agent?”
    & Neither of us knew what that meant — a local agent? I thought it may have been some mistranslation, we had the permits to get into any port in Japan. No one had ever told us anything about needing a local agent.
    - “Hum, we don't have that.”
    - “Then I am sorry, you cannot enter Shimizu Port.”
    & I froze. Devine & I were looking forward to resting and eating a proper meal for once, not just that, the sun was down and the night was very, very cold. I’d told Devine to not enter the harbour because we didn't have permission, he was driving Pino around in the circles in the quarantine area near the entrance while I was trying to sort this all out.
    - “Our sail is damaged, we need a dock to make repairs!”
    & I was getting desperate then, the fatigue of the last 4 days of sailing in rough weather was weighing me down. 
    - “You need a local agent. I will give you a number so you can call.”
    & I groaned then. 
    - “I don’t have a phone number, I just got here!”
    - “Okay. Then you’ll need to speak to the Coastguard.”
    & I called the coastguard on the radio then, but they were treating us like they would a large cargo ship. The questions she asked didn’t apply to us. When I tried to explain our situation she just apologized, I’d reached the limit of her English and she left the channel. 
    - “The FUCK was THAT!!”
    & I was beyond angry at that point, frustrated by Japanese bureaucracy. I could hear Devine outside then...
    - “The hell is going on?!”
    - “Coastguard hung up on me! They won’t let us into the port.”
    & Devine was shivering violently and was also short on patience.
    - “What? No way we're staying out here. Take the tiller, I’ll speak to them!”
    & Devine was alternating speaking to the Shimizu port radio and the Coastguard. About 15 minutes later, Devine told me to head into port and gave me a set of coordinates.
    - “We can bring Pino to this berth. They said it was next to a boat called Dawn Treader.”
    - "How the hell did you get permission?”
    & Devine told them it was a force majeure, that we had repairs to do and that we had no other options. He also said that we had all the necessary papers and even gave them references of people we knew in Japan (contacts of other Japanese sailors we'd met in Ogasawara). All in all, we wanted to say the same thing but Devine said it in a way that was concise, important when dealing with people with english as their second language. 
    - “I said what they wanted to hear, that’s all. Got us in didn't I?”
    & I have so much love for this human, and remember thinking how lost I'd be without him. Devine, my savior. Going back out there was not an option for us, we knew we couldn’t take another night at sea. 
    & We motored past the breakwater and inside of the Port of Shimizu. The coordinates that they’d given us brought us to the marina, but not at a dock. We thought this was a mistake and so we circled around the marina a few times to try and find the boat named Dawn Treader — no luck. It was hard to see the names in the dark. We slipped into a random berth and decided to try and find the boat on foot. As soon as we docked, we got another call from the port radio.
    - “You’re in the wrong slip.”
    & They were keeping an eye on us with AIS and could see we weren’t where we were supposed to be. We’d assumed the coordinates were wrong, but in truth we’re the ones who’d messed up. The dock in question was a public dock, a concrete wall. We assumed it wasn’t a place where we could dock because there there was a large 100 foot yacht on it, with colored lights in the rigging. We didn’t think that this boat was Dawn Treader, it looked like a show-boat — they failed to tell us how big the boat was, in hindsight, we should have asked. We pushed away from the berth at the marina and found a place at the concrete wall, tying Pino up to a set of heavy bollards (35 0.632'N 138 29.699'E). This was the {Shimizu public dock(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5332304654237696/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557533878040)}. As soon as tied up, we heard a call from Shimizu Port radio again.
    - “You can stay there, but you cannot go to shore.”
    & I looked at Devine, desperation mounting.
    - “Well this just keeps getting better and better huh?”
    & When we asked questions, they just said to stay on the boat and to not leave unless absolutely necessary. I was freaking out. We had repairs to make and we’d just arrived on mainland Japan...! This was our dream and we couldn’t step foot on land? We felt like criminals, or worse yet, prisoners. Both of us were depressed, frustrated with Japanese bureaucracy. 
    & Japan had recently instated a cruising permit that made it possible for smaller boats — like us — to enter closed ports without having to ask for permission. We thought that this permit would allow us to go into anywhere, but now there was something going on that we didn’t understand. We hadn’t send a pre-arrival notice to this port, but we’d read that in an emergency — which it was — that we could enter any port, with the condition that we’d notify the coastguard as soon as possible. We’d spoken to the coastguard on arrival on the radio and still it seemed like it wasn’t okay for us to be here. We went to bed that night, shivering and sad, hoping that tomorrow would be better. Either way, being stuck here was better than beating into the waves and wind out there.
    & Early the next morning, we woke up to a clear sky and calm waters, with a view of Fujisan. We could see it rising out of horizon from our window, it was unreal. 
    % blog/shimizu_26.jpg
    & Now that it was daytime, we could see our new neighbourhood better. We were next to a public area, with many tourists hanging around, camera in hand, to take pictures of Mount Fuji. It’s likely that Pino is present in many tourists photos, because we were moored right near a famous picture spot. 
    % blog/shimizu_4.jpg
    & Soon, we saw a group of Japanese men in work wear approaching the boat, it was the coastguard. 
    - “Not this again…” 
    & We showed them our papers, everything they asked for. They were much more pleasant in person than on the radio, no unpleasantness what-so-ever. They were happy we were here and would point things out to us, places we should go see. Devine & I started to feel better then, we’d misunderstood their tone on the radio the night before. Japanese people are bound by rules, there is a set protocol that they need to adhere to and if a situation arises that doesn’t fit into that, they won’t know how to respond to it, or at least, they will be reluctant to act because the last thing they want is to go against the rules. They need to go through the proper channels, to make sure that their decision is okay with everyone. In the port of Shimizu, there are many people that are involved in allowing a boat into Port. This is what we had experienced last night, an overall reluctance to make a decision, a desire to stick to the rules. 
    & The coastguard explained that customs officials would come and see us, only after their visit would we be allowed ashore. Devine & I looked at each other then, happy to hear that we weren’t really prisoners here, just victims of a very complex system. After customs came, we were free to roam! 
    % blog/shimizu_27.jpg
    & They had allowed us to stay for 1 month on the public dock, to do repairs as needed. It wasn’t a bad place to be, very central and right near a mall. “S-pulse dream plaza” is a gigantic complex, complete with a Ferris wheel and Thomas the train rides. On the first few days we relied on that mall for internet, sitting in the “wifi area” while a Doraemon mascot screamed into a microphone, surrounded by a horde of kids. Early in the morning we’d sit outside, the mall only opened at 10am but the wifi was always on. We’d sit at a table and check our messages, as joggers did their morning runs around the basin. 
    % blog/shimizu_22.jpg
    & From that time onward, we met a lot of locals. People would often walk near the boat and stop to say hello, this is how we met Kazupon and Nobu. These two local sailors were very welcoming, they came on the first day and invited us for lunch. We went to a delicious ‘all you can eat and drink place’, they assured us that there would be many vegan options for us. It was noon and we sat with them for 2 hours, eating and having an early nomihodai (all you can drink). They were excited to meet us and to hear stories of where we’d been. We too, were happy to finally get in touch with other Japanese sailors. They heard we were looking for a more permanent berth here in Shimizu and began calling friends on the spot to find one for us. We hadn’t asked for help but they insisted on it, saying they knew people who could, and would help. We couldn’t believe it. Later that week, they also invited us for a nabe night on Kazupon’s boat. 
    & Kazupon was a dentist, he spoke good enough English and could help translate what Nobu was saying. Nobu was a retired electrician and professional sailor, we also learned later that he’s very good at making soba. The evening of the dinner on Kazupon’s boat, we agreed to a soba battle, for Devine to make homemade soba and to test it against Nobu san’s. We were all very drunk that night and it seemed like a good idea. 
    % blog/shimizu_21.jpg
    & The day of the soba battle, we walked into Nobu's atelier with our mortar and pestle and our buckwheat berries, ready to dazzle him with our soba-making skills. Upon entering the room, we saw a soba-making station with a soba cutting knife laying over it, 'soba kiri' knives have a straight and long cutting edge to enable straight precise cut on the board to keep the width of the noodles consistent. The heavy weight of the knife assist in cutting of the noodles, usually with a slight forward cutting motion. This is a highly specialized blade, used only in soba-making, we realized then that our host wasn't a mere enthusiast, he was a true soba master. 
    & The room was equipped with a large stone grinder and the biggest mixing bowl I’d ever seen. Around the room sat pieces of pottery, because Nobu was a man of many skills. He was an electrician, a sailor, a soba master and a potter. Needless to say we didn't win the soba battle, but we did learn a few tricks! We continued to do evenings with these two afterward, going to eat soba in restaurants or joining them for tempura parties on the marina docks. 
    & We also met the crew of our dock neighbour Dawn treader, namely an engineer and amazing sailor named Masa. We became fast friends and did many activities together in Shimizu. In fact, on the first day he offered to help us with laundry (since the coin laundry was far) and even invited us over to his place so we have a proper warm shower. We'd only just met, and already we were in his appartment using his shower and eating his food. 
    % blog/shimizu_9.jpg
    & On another occasion, Masa invited us aboard Dawn Treader for a meal and an evening of magic and shamisen-playing — I kid you not. We met his partner Yukari and his friend Kamo.
    % blog/shimizu_18.jpg
    & Like many Japanese people we’d met, everyone had some special skill or hidden talent. Kamo played the shamisen beautifully, his performance was interspersed with random acts of magic. It was surreal. We realized that night that magic isn't simply about doing the trick, it also requires a lot of acting and energy. Masa and Yukari also revealed some of their own talents, performing a cover of Kurenai by X Japan on the ukulele.
    % blog/shimizu_14.jpg
    & Masa and Yukari treated us to many more fun outings, we attended a tea ceremony together. It was our first time seeing tea fields, rows upon rows of bushes lined up on a hill. The tea ceremony was simple, our host was dressed in a pink kimono and moved with incredible precision and grace. 
    % blog/shimizu_19.jpg
    & Every movement was delicate and deliberate, there was no waste in it, no mistakes as if she’d done it over a thousand times. It was beautiful to watch. Our host served us a cup of warm matcha, along with a little red bean bun. 
    % blog/shimizu_6.jpg
    & This wasn’t our first time in Japan, but it was our first time experiencing Omotenashi, or hospitality. Everyone made sure we were happy and comfortable and were eager to take us out to introduce us to the various flavours of Japanese culture. We accepted every offer, humbled by their kindness and friendship. Most times our friends insisted on paying for the meals we had at restaurants, this made us feel uncomfortable because we aren’t used to it. In Montreal everyone always pays for their own share, no one expects special favors — only on very, very special occasions. Both of us looked at each other everytime we were treated to an expensive meal, we wondered if we should insist on paying our fair share but after trying many times we simply decided to just smile and say thank you. 
    & They were happy to treat us to these experiences, that’s just how it is here in Japan. We kept all of these kind gestures in mind, hoping that we’ll find a way to repay them somehow. Although, we know that Japanese people don't do these things expecting something back, it's just them being kind, them wanting to share what they love of their culture with you. For once, we decided to let them do these things for us, to just be in the moment and to not feel guilty.
    % blog/shimizu_17.jpg
    & Between outings, we did repairs on Pino, ordering new slides for the main as well as a new toilet pump. We knew we wouldn't be able to stay here in Shimizu, even if we did enjoy being here. The public marina did not have berths for foreign boats, Kazupon and Nobu did try to get us in there but it was impossible. Our only option was {Fujisan Hagoromo Marina(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5911018211377152/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534002631)} in Orido. Like many other marinas in Japan, this marina only allows visitors to stay for 7 days per month. That was a problem for us. The weather out there was still too crazy, strong westerlies in the high 40's. We couldn't go out there even if we wanted to, heading south in such winds would be dangerous. At that point we thought of heading north instead, we did some research on marinas in the Yokohama and Tokyo area but these were too expensive. We quickly had to abandon that idea. A slip in that area would cost about 1300$ a month, that's more expensive than an appartment!
    & We knew we could stay on the concrete wall indefinitely, but the hard surface can be very damaging on a boat. We spent 2 weeks moored to that wall, our fender board ground thin by the barnacles and concrete. We had to leave the boat for a week to go to Tokyo but didn't want to leave it there, it's then that Nobu and Kazupon came through for us once again. They found us a spot at the local fishing club pontoon in Orido (34 59.243N 138 30.479E). The pontoon was old and rickety, but they assured us that all would be fine. We'd be able to leave the boat here, behind a locked gate during our absence. The best part? It was 100% free. We met the owner of the pontoon during a tempura party, he was more than happy to help us out. We ran into him many times during our stay on that dock, he would always come by and check up on us and to make sure everything was okay, especially during days when the wind was strong. 
    % blog/shimizu_7.jpg
    & Leaving Pino is always worrisome, but we felt confident that this was a good place. We packed our bikes and left Shimizu to go to Tokyo. We wanted to spend time there with friends, to cycle through our favorite neighborhoods and to just relax for once, to not think of boat stuff at all. We landed at Shinagawa station in Tokyo, put our bikes back together and cycled over to our friend Chase's place west of Shibuya. On the way, we passed through many neighborhoods, by Meguro, Daikanyama, Shibuya and over to Shimo-Takaido.
    % blog/shimizu_10.jpg
    & During our short stay in Tokyo we went back to some of the places we liked, and found some new treasures, like Chabuzen, a place that makes amazing vegan tonkotsu-style ramen. It was still very cold then, but the sakura trees were beginning to bloom. Many streets were dotted with pink petals, when the wind would blow some of these would go flying and would swirl all around, it was like being in a snowglobe.
    & On our return from Tokyo we moved the boat into Fujisan Hagoromo Marina (34 59.316'N 138 30.564'E) for one week, to fill water and to get ready for our sail south to Minami Ise. 
    % blog/shimizu_5.jpg
    & {Hagoromo Marina(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5911018211377152/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534002631)} wasn't cheap, but at least we had power there and could run our electric heater in the mornings (was still very cold then) and could take hot showers — ah, been so long since we've had that! What luxury. We also used our stay in this marina as an opportunity to get rid of a few items aboard Pino. It's very hard to dispose of steel, large objets or objects consisting of mixed materials in Japan, the marina would take care of it all for us. It was during this time that we said goodbye to our dinghy Iggy. Iggy, as you know, was a real hazard. It couldn't float anymore, and it couldn't be fixed. We'll miss you Iggy, you've served us well.
    & Shimizu is now one of our favorite places in Japan. We enjoyed local specialities like flavored yokan, and very much enjoyed cycling around Miho through the forests and industrial area. Everywhere we went in Shimizu, we could see Mount Fuji, we never did grow tired of seeing it. 
    % blog/shimizu_2.jpg
    & I think it's safe to say we've seen Fujisan in every manner possible, with clouds obscuring its top (like it had a hat) or skirting it's middle or bottom. Some days, the sky was so clear that I could see snow blowing off its peak. 
    & Our arrival here was challenging, but we pushed on, pulled through and everything worked out. Devine & I are stronger together, that is something I've always known but that is even more apparent in tough situations. We now have eyes set on the next port on our list: Shima Yacht Harbor in Minami-Ise.
    & Saying goodbye to this place wasn't easy, we made a lot of friends here. I'd like to thank Masa, Yukari, Joe, Kamo, Nobu and Kazupon for making our stay in Shimizu memorable. Every Japanese sailor we met expressed a desire to go out there, to push off the dock — in a more permanent way — and to travel the oceans. It makes us happy to hear that, because it means we'll likely run into each other again. 
    & We made a video of our time in Shimizu, check it out {here(https://youtu.be/1uJuEADyYhY)}.

    Location : Chichijima, Ogasawara, Japan. 
    Date : 2019-03-01
  Arriving in Chichijima
    % blog/ogasawara_12.jpg
    & After a long 21-day passage, seeing the shape of the island of {Chichijima(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5888907224809472/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557533713543)} in the distance was unreal; this was our prize, our first step onto Japanese soil. We used to make many trips to Japan by plane, but getting there by our own efforts — by sailboat — is a lot slower and harder. If we had stuck to our plan of sailing there via Hawaii, we would have been there sooner, but I’m glad we took the long route. We passed through 9 countries, learned a lot about the world and, through it all, we've surpassed ourselves.
    % blog/ogasawara_10.jpg
    & During that time, we often talked about what it would be like to arrive in Japan, about what would happen when we did. You have to remember that this was a big deal for us, a milestone in our lives and the culmination of 3 years of hard work. A fantasy made real is a hell of an achievement. A part of me couldn’t believe we’d made it — anytime now I’d wake up mid-ocean in transit in the South Pacific. Even when I’d have my feet planted on the ground, with a Japanese flag flying above my head, I knew I’d be anxious, waiting for something horrible to happen that would rob us of our victory. 
    & "They’ll turn us away.", "We’ve landed on the wrong island." or "We died in the pacific some months ago, and this is limbo."
    % blog/ogasawara_11.jpg
    & My eyes were set on the phantasmic island ahead. The sun fell out of the sky then, drawing down a star-studded curtain; the wind blew itself out, leaving the sea to settle into an unmoving and creepy oil slick.
    - "This really is limbo."
    & A bright circle appeared on the horizon then. It isn’t the first or the last time that I mistake the moonrise for a ship, or the bright eye of some mythological beast. 
    & At this point, it looked like we’d be entering Futami port at night, but at least we had the eye of Sauron to light the way. The island in the distance stopped being a vague black patch, and we began to see details in it. As {Pino(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/boat/4733784360484864/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534132049)} passed the first set of buoys, lights and buildings came into view. I stood at the bow with a flashlight to illuminate any coming threats, and to warn others of our arrival because at this point our red and green lights weren’t working. Pino bucked hard on this trip, bow diving deep — we blame this for the breakage. 
    & The famous ferry, Ogasawara Maru, sat idly at the dock; the giant was sleeping, and we glided past it in silence, undetected. We pushed into the main fishing harbour, and as promised, all was clearly marked and visible in the night. Our docking space was unoccupied, but there was one problem... the wall we had to moor onto stood a lot higher than I could jump. I stared, wide-eyed, docking line in hand.
    - “I don’t think I can make that.”
    - “Sure you can!” 
    & Devine said, with blind confidence.
    - "You’ve seen my legs! Not much spring in these stumps! Um. Maybe if I stand on the pulpit…” 
    & Pino was approaching the dock slowly. I wondered if I could lasso the bollards. I’ve never done that and had no reason to believe it could work, but my mind raced on — what else could I do? My brain had no filter and conjured up many options that it knew would be impossible for this body of mine to perform; maybe I could put a foot on the lifelines, or swing off a halyard ‘a-la-tarzan’… Hell, maybe I could grow wings. Before I could decide, I heard Devine’s voice.
    - “There’s a ladder!”
    & My jumping skills would go untested.

    & I secured Pino to the pier. During this precarious operation no one fell into the water or smashed a knee into a winch; even our toes suffered no damage —  a rarity aboard Pino. We’ve harmed our toes so often that they’ve threatened to atrophy. 
    & A coastguard official was there to greet us.
    - "You must stay on boat" he said to us, in broken english.
    & We apologized, climbing back on Pino island. The official told us that they would clear us in tomorrow morning at 8:30 am — perfect. It was 9pm then, meaning we’d have time to relax and clean up our mess of a home. We slept very well that night, as we tend to do after a long passage, our brains longing for more than 3 consecutive hours of sleep.

    & The next morning, the officials stood on the dock, ready to push papers at us. There was about 5 or 6 of them, I feared everyone would try to come aboard at once but instead they boarded us in pairs, taking turns. 
    & Quarantine asked if we had any plants, I said no, showing them the last bit of fresh food we had aboard: a dry and wrinkly knob of ginger. We signed our names many times, and used our very best Japanese. We could understand most of what they said, but the official papers had many kanji; the thought of trying to translate it all made me hot in the head. At least we wouldn’t have to — many of the documents had English and the ones that didn’t were permits and I was confident I already knew what was written on them, which is enough, really. Customs came aboard next, asking us for the purpose of our visit.
    - “Tabemono.” (food)
    & He smiled at this.
    & For immigration, we had to step off Pino and visit their office in town. There, they had the same devices that are present in airports to check you in, the ones that take your photo and a scan of your index fingers. We filled a card that is given out on planes, except that instead of flight number we wrote “Pino”. This amused us. Welcome aboard airship Pino!

    & When we stepped into a Japanese konbini (convenience store), it’s then that I started to get excited! When I first sampled karashi, or drank a cold yebisu, everything around me became less translucent, we had eaten the food of that world and like Chihiro we lost our human scent and became creatures of Chichijima. This place wasn’t some cruel hallucination — it was real! 
    & We soon picked up our old habits, making food the way we used to in Tokyo and eating the same snacks. It felt like we’d returned to a state of normality, like we’d never left and that the whole sailboat thing was a dream. A quick look around dispelled that reverie, a Japanese way to describe this feeling is:
    - 夢擬き(yume modoki)
    & It’s dream-like, but isn’t one. 
    - この生活は、夢擬きだね。
    % blog/ogasawara_23.jpg
    & Chichijima isn’t a big place, and, unlike Tokyo, here the clock runs slow. There is no real rush to do anything. Stores close at regular hours, at 5pm konbinis and groceries are shut — it is a healthy way to live. There are only 2,500 people on this island, and most live near here in Omura, Okumura, Kiyose and Miyanohama. There are other towns further away, to the south east of the bay: Sakaiura, Ougiura, Komagari and Kominato.  
    % blog/ogasawara_22.jpg
    & There are few stores and businesses. For locals it can get expensive to live here, the rent is high and not much is sold on the island. If you want clothes, furniture, electronics… these have to be imported from the mainland. There is no plane service here either — if people want to visit, or if they want to order goods from mainland Japan, it needs to come by ship (via Ogasawara Maru). The arrival of the ferry – which comes every 2 to 3 days – is a big deal for the town, not just because it means they’re getting their packages, but also because there is fresh foods and because it brings tourists to the island. On the day the ship arrives, boxes of fresh food are piled up high in front of the grocery stores, and employees are busy placing them on the shelves while the local people are filling their baskets. Two days after the stores are replenished, there are much fewer items available, the locals have raided the produce section and robbed it of all colour. 
    % blog/ogasawara_4.jpg
    & The people of Chichijima rely heavily on tourism for money — the locals give dive tours, walking tours, operate restaurants or souvenir shops. All business depends on the visitors. Because we stayed here 3 weeks, we saw the ship coming and going many times and we noticed that some shops would close the day before, and after the ship leaves. The town and Ogasawara Maru share a schedule. If you don’t know it, it can be confusing, but at least it’s easy to know if the ship is here or not, because it is a behemoth and you can see it from away, and because the streets are full of people with windbreakers and bucket hats. When the ship leaves, the town makes a show of it — locals gather at the pier, waving, while others bang on taiko drums. When the ship sails out, dive and tour boats escort it to the entrance to the harbour, the people on it waving and yelling "Itterasshai!" (see you later.) Devine & I were witness to these elaborate festivities once. We stood at the pier too as Ogasawara Maru left; waving, as if we too lived here. The people here value visitors, and giving them a memorable send off is important.
    & We met many locals on the island. Having a yacht is a conversation starter, it’s like having a baby, a dog or some weird pet; we like to think Pino fits in that last category.
    - え！ヨットすごい！(Wow, nice yacht!) 
    - いえ、大きなペリーカンだよ。(No, that’s a giant pelican.)  
    & Many people would come by, see our boat and say hello, asking where we’re from and why we have Japanese writing on our boat.
    - “Otaku desu.” 
    & We would say, shamelessly.
    % blog/ogasawara_14.jpg
    & We made a few friends on the island, and because of our conversations, we learned a lot about Chichijima. Many here have multiple jobs, odd jobs you can say. We met one person who was in charge of servicing and replenishing vending machines on the island. His other job was loading and unloading supplies from the ferry. Another person, our dear friend Bariton, repairs bicycles, volunteers at a garden and works at the town’s visitor center. We had a really amazing time with Bariton and his wife Chie. They graciously invited us into their home, where we shared stories, and had a tasting of their homemade miso. On another occasion, they invited us over for dinner and served vegetable tempura and homemade azuki with yakimochi. I think the reason they served us this, was because Bariton came on the boat once and saw an empty can of tsubuan from the store. 
    - “They put a lot of sugar in that.” 
    & The dessert Chie made was amazing and its canned equivalent pales in comparison, the taste is subtle and the sugar content is much lower – homemade is best. On March 3rd is Hinamatsuri (girl's day), Bariton showed up that morning with a plate of sakura mochi, pink rice cakes that are wrapped in a pickled shiso leaf, and stuffed with sweet red beans. Another local came by too, with two little dolls (雛人形 "hina-ningyou"), to make sure we could take part in the festivities that day – so nice of them.
    % blog/ogasawara_15.jpg
    & Before we arrived, we were looking forward to being in a place where we could cycle again, to have a foot on land. When at anchor bringing our bikes ashore with the dinghy is always difficult, and even then, the roads in some of the places we'd been were less than ideal. But here, in Japan, the streets are clean and immaculate. Biking in Chichijima was especially great because there aren’t many cars here — the ferry can’t accommodate them and so the roads are not very busy. We went for many joyrides, exploring the island on two wheels. Ah, how we missed this! This place is very mountainous, so we had to walk our bikes often; but after 3 weeks of inactivity at sea our atrophied flesh much enjoyed the exercise. Every hill top offered a scenery worthy of being painted; dramatic cliffs, clear waters and colourful reefs.
    % blog/ogasawara_16.jpg
    - “Are we really in Japan?”.
    & We’d ask ourselves. Our previous experience of Japan was really different, we lived on the water but it didn’t have a crystalline quality, not like this. Here, walking by the pier and peering into the water, we’d see moorish idols pecking at the barnacles on the sea wall, sharing the buffet with other species of colourful fish I’ve yet to put a name to. One day we even spotted a 6-foot shark swimming in the shallows by the pier, crossing paths with the biggest sting ray we’d ever seen. 
    % blog/ogasawara_21.jpg
    & Even amongst the trees, we’d see animals, like a family of wild goats (noyagi) munching on some greenery on the side of the road, or green anoles hiding under leaves of matching colour. 
    % blog/ogasawara_17.jpg
    & We always imagined that during our first week here, we’d spend all our money eating out, but that’s not what we did – like the locals, we too raided the groceries. We bought nagaimo, aonori, maitake, renkon, karashi, myoga, soba, shiso ume… our lockers were filled with Japanese goods. Everything we ate was sweet and fresh, very different from the bland and near-rotted produce available in Majuro. 
    & I nearly lost it when I had a first taste of local cabbage. I know what you’re thinking. Cabbage? Yes, it is a humble ingredient, it’s something we rely on a lot on passage and that we’ve eaten often in the past, but it always served more as a filler in meals and was never the highight of the plate. The cabbage we bought that day was fresh, wet and crisp, as if we’d just picked it out of the garden of a skilled farmer, juices flowing from its stem still. We'd eat the leaves as a snack and savored every bite. Devine & I were smitten with this cruciferous wonder.  
    % blog/ogasawara_24.jpg
    & We also had some tomatoes harvested in Hahajima, an island just south of Chichijima. These tomatoes, we were told, are very expensive. Bariton offered us a few of these lovely red jewels, a fruit so sweet that it defied all logic. 
    & I forgot that vegetables, and fruit could taste this good. This is what Majuro has done to us, it made us forget that each has its own distinct flavor. Here in Chichijima, every ingredient was a precious and delicate note, each playing its part in the meal to create a synchronous whole. 
    & Our first week here we made every Japanese dish we could think of, like homemade okonomiyaki, tororo soba, agedashi tofu, konnyaku sashimi, karashi renkon… we also bought some umeshu, and drank plenty of Yebisu beer. 
    % blog/ogasawara_18.jpg
    & It really is an ideal place. 
    & We like to try and imagine what it would be like to live here. In truth, we do that everywhere we are, but here takes the crown. We can bike, the food is good, we can walk in the forest, there are many trees, the water is near… and also, here, we’ve got internet and plenty of opportunities to talk in Japanese. 
    & This is no dream.
    & We will never grow tired of hearing the goji no chaimu, or the five o’clock bell, a sound that is common for the Japanese but that has a special meaning for us. The first time I heard it here in Chichijima, a lump formed in my throat. I’d forgotten all about this detail about living in Japan. 
    % blog/ogasawara_20.jpg
    & The song is soothing and sweet, and when it rings you know you’re in Japan.
    & I've written a guide on {(sailing in Japan)}, and one other about cruising in {Ogasawara(Ogasawara Cruising Guide)}. We've also made a {video(https://youtu.be/ueTCjpNXing)} about our time in Chichijima. 
 
The promise of pancakes
  SETTINGS
    Location : Majuro, The Marshall islands
    Date : 2018-11-26
  Checking into Majuro
    % blog/majuro.3.jpg
    & Checking into New Zealand was a breeze (they did confiscate the inch of ginger I had left, but no matter); in French Polynesia the officials were laid back and we could have easily been there for more than 3 months with no one noticing; Tonga had endless paperwork and a scary customs dock - all this to say that clearance procedures from country to country varies a lot. Checking in can be a pleasant experience, but this isn't true for all places and so far the Marshall islands takes the crown - they'd win at the 'most confusing entrance into a country' awards. 
    & As soon as we'd tied to our mooring ball in Majuro's lagoon, the worries of the previous 24 days had vanished only to replaced by the crushing weight of responsibility. Devine, being worry-free, was like...
    - "Let's have pancakes! Sleep. Then tomorrow we'll check in!"
    & But Devine knows how uptight I am, and that this was not what we'd be doing first (even if it is what I wanted too). My thinking is that I'd rather get the paperwork out of the way first, to get all of that worrying out of me so I can then eat pancakes in peace. 
    - "Shut up and get dressed."
    & We needed to be presentable for the officials, we had to wear clean clothes with pants that reach over your knees (a lot of countries in the pacific don't want to see your knees - I get it, knees are weird). We dug out some clothes from our bins, and then went back on deck to give Iggy the dinghy 'the kiss of life'. 
    % blog/majuro.5.jpg
    & Our neighbour, a bearded American guy named Charlie, rowed over in his inflatable. We were downwind from him so he didn't bother using his outboard. 
    - "Hey guys! How you doing?"
    - "Salty, but otherwise good."
    & Charlie had been here for a little while already, and gave us some tips and recommendations for Majuro. 
    - "Custom and immigration are right next to each other, but it's a bit of a walk. You're better of taking a cab, it costs 1$ per person. Everyone here takes cabs. You just gatta stick your hand out when you see one with your fingers indicating the amount of ppl who need a ride, if they've got room they'll stop otherwise they'll flash their lights and keep going."
    & Our new neighbour told us about the restaurants here, a good one being a place that Devine understood to be called "Thai table", and I, as "Lanai Table" (don't ask me why). Both of us were sure of what we'd heard, so we didn't bother to ask him to repeat it. Later, we learned it was called "Tide Table". Charlie must have been confused when Devine asked him if he thought the Thai food there was good. 
    & At that point we knew where to find everything. We knew where to get beer, food, internet and where to check in. Charlie did mention that tomorrow was a holiday though, so that if we wanted to get these things we'd need to do it today.
    & We said thanks to Charlie then, getting ready to step foot on land after 24 days on the ocean. We put our passports and clearance papers from Fiji in our dry bag, attached Turnip the outboard to Iggy's rump and motored over to the dinghy dock ashore next to a bar called "Shoreline". The small dock had fishing boats moored onto it, but at the back of it near the ramp were other dinghies so we left Iggy there so it could socialize.
    & As soon as we stepped ashore we noticed our legs felt weird, like the ground was pushing up against our feet. This a symptom of land-sickness, of having spent too much time at sea; neither of us felt ill, but it did take some time before we could walk like regular humans again. 
    & We walked past the bar to try and find the main road - easy enough, Majuro has only one. We knew that the customs and immigration offices were to the south of the island, so we stood on the right side of the road to catch a cab in that direction. Devine spotted a cab then, stuck out two fingers but it was full, the driver flashed their lights and continued on. We did this for every cab. The first 5 were completely full! 
    - "Wow" I said then, "Everyone here take cabs?"
    & We think that many do yes, and for short distances too. The street was mostly occupied by cabs, there were few cars around. We thought then that maybe this was 'rush hour', but I realized later that it was near noon and that it was possible that a lot of people were going home for lunch (this is true of Mexico and many other South pacific islands). In many countries a lot of businesses close around noon and open again around 1 or 2pm; I didn't make the connection in my brain then, that the government offices may also be closed, I was too busy trying to find a cab to pick us up.
    & One cab did stop, it had two spots available; we sat inside, saying a friendly "hello!" and realizing then again that we had no idea how to say hello or anything else in Marshallese. (We learned later that "Hello" is "Yokwe", pronounced 'yi-yak-wey'.)
    - "To the immigration office!" 
    & I said, stupidly. The cab driver did not respond to this right away, maybe they called the immigration office something else here. I'd heard that people here often make use of acronyms to refer to either banks, stores of government offices. Right now, I wished i'd taken the time to find out what that acronym is, if any. The driver asked something in Marshallese to the other guy in the cab, perhaps looking for some clarification. 
    & The passenger replied in Marshallese, I understood nothing but the word 'finance'.
    - "AH - yes! Finance! That's it!" I said.
    & Charlie had said that the customs office had the word 'finance' on it. 
    & While in the cab we took in our surroundings, it was very grey and rainy that day but people were cooking food on grills anyway, the rain helped to subdue the cloud of black smoke rising from the metallic BBQs. A restaurant had stalks of bananas laid out on tables on the storefront, as well as some pinecone-looking type of fruit that I've never seen before. That's something I love about arriving in new places, seeing something I'm unfamiliar with and learning to cook with it. The restaurant also had breadfruit, but they were smaller than the ones I was used to, and oblong-shaped. We took note of the stores, going past a few supermarkets like Island pride., Payless and EZ mart. We had no more veggies so we'd have to stop by later to get something.
    & At this point we thought we could get back to the boat before 13h so we could make our delicious pancake meal with coffee. I was salivating at the thought of it, my tired brain required caffeine and fidgeted uncomfortably in my skull.
    - "Hey... hey didn't you forget something? Where's the brown brew? I need my fix!"
    & When in a cab in Majuro passengers don't call out where they want to go when getting in, in fact we were startled by the absence of conversation; people usually just say when they want to get off, like on a bus. When you board a cab, you have to make sure its going the right way because a car going south will not go north for you, it goes in that direction and that's it. This system only works in places like this, where land space is limited and when there's only one road. The cab stops for people as long as there is room, and will keep going until the end of the island is reached, then turn around and go the other way.
    & The cab ride was short, the driver dropped us off in front of the office with the word 'finance' on it. We paid him two dollars -one for each of us- and stepped out. 
  Customs and immigration
    & We decided to go see immigration first in the next building, situated on the 3rd floor (thanks Charlie!). We took the elevator, the door opening onto a space that was under some serious construction. We asked the first person we saw, making sure that this was where immigration was and they nodded, pointing to a door at the end of a short corridor. The door was closed, and had a sign on it stating that because of construction the office operated on a limited schedule and closed at noon.
    & Uh oh.
    & The immigration office was closed for the day, tomorrow was a holiday, and then it was the weekend. It wouldn't open until Monday. We stared at the door for a while, saying nothing, as if trying to process it all inwardly. Then a guy noticed we were staring and asked if we were looking to check in.
    - "Yes please!"
    & This was the immigration officer, the office had just closed but he re-opened it and offered to check us in. We filled in the papers he pushed in front of us and he took our clearance papers from Fiji... then our passports, but he looked at them and then gave them back.
    - "You have to come back some other time." 
    & He said to us. We looked at him, confused. 
    - "Why can't we have the passports stamped now?"
    - "No more time." 
    & I understood that we were impeding on his lunch hour, but if this was a problem he wouldn't have re-opened the office for us, we didn't force his hand. This didn't make sense. Either way, there wasn't much we could do about it. Then, he spoke again.
    - "Tomorrow at 10 o’clock, meet me at Shoreline. I will stamp your passports."
    & We said 'ok', not sure what else to do. On the way out though, I remembered someone warning us that Marshallese officials will sometimes try to trick you into checking in after hours so they can charge you extra 'processing' fees (150$). Tomorrow was a holiday, we hoped that him feigning to not have enough time wasn't really just an attempt at making some extra cash. 
    & Ugh. We'd deal with this tomorrow, at least immigration was aware we were in the country. We strolled over to customs, but they were closed for lunch and were supposed to re-open at 14h. It was now 12h15, we had some waiting to do and so Devine suggested we go and get some data for our phones and then stop to have lunch at Tide Table. I was hungry, but hungry for something specific; I wanted to be in a dry place with a cup of coffee and some pancakes. I knew I couldn't have that now, and this put me in a terrible mood; because of my moodiness we couldn't agree on anything. I wanted things I couldn't have and acted like a small child in tears over my parents not wanting to pull the moon down from the sky for me, like THEY were the unreasonable ones - note that I regress when I'm tired and thoroughly decaffeinated. I'm amazed that Devine always manages to remain non-affected by my despair and negativity.
    - "Hey, it's okay." 
    & Devine would say, smiling. 
    & We were hiding from the rain in front of the 'finance' office, talking and trying to make a decision when we spotted the immigration officer getting into his car. First, he backed onto a traffic cone, then it got wedged between the wheel and body of the car, he stuck his head out, but didn't look like he wanted to deal with it so he drove on. We watched him disappear down the road, a bright orange cone trapped under his car, dragging on the pavement and making an awful racket.
    & We laughed. This helped coax me back into a good mood. If we wanted to get internet, we'd have to cab there, then, cab back to Tide Table... then, cab over here at the customs office again only to cab back yet again to go back to the boat. I don't like riding in cars, nor paying for transport, but since the street has little to no sidewalks and that the road was bordered by giant puddles of water I stuck out two fingers at the passing cabs.
    - "Getting internet probably won't take long, then we can eat! Food? Remember food and how it makes you happy?"   
    & My stomach growled at these words, as if the word 'food' could give me sustenance. 
    - "Fine." 
  Internet
    & We took a cab over to {*NTA*}, an internet service provider here in Majuro. We went to sit in the waiting room, facing a giant green wall with a large "4G" cutout, it looked like a pop-up store, with the two employees sitting in front of a folding table, made pretty with a green flowered cloth. The youngest of the two employees waved us over. 
    - "How can I help you?"
    - "We need internet on our phones, says on the wall you've got unlimited. We want that."
    - "Let me see your phone." 
    & He asked. After looking it over, he shook his head.
    - "Your phone is too told - LTE requires Iphone 6 and up."
    & We had an Iphone 5S. We thought it funny to come here, in a lonely atoll in the Marshalls only to be told that our phone was too old; looking around, we could see everyone had better phones than we did - and we're supposed to be game developers...! 
    - "Is there another internet provider in Majuro?" Devine asked.
    & The two employees laughed at this, as if it had been a joke question. We had our answer. When the laughing ceased they suggested we get a pocket wifi, it costs 70$ for the device and then another 70$ for 50G of data (speed slows when limit is reached). We had no choice.
    - "Okay, we'll go for that then."
    - "Great! But we've run out! We're getting some more this afternoon. Come back after 2!"
    & Just our luck. We really wanted to get internet today, because we feared the office would be closed tomorrow. We would have to find something else to do (again) and come back at that time to get the device. 
  Tide Table
    & By that time both of us were starving and figured that after this evergrowing list of failures, getting some food was a good idea. We hailed a cab and stopped at Tide Table, a restaurant annexed to a hotel called the "RRE". Walking around town that day, we noticed many building had that same acronym; it stands for "Robert Reimers Enterprises" - they own a lot of buildings and stores here in Majuro. Tide Table is a bright blue building, at first glance it looks like some kind of aquarium. We climbed up to the second floor to the restaurant and took a seat inside; it was air-conditioned and because our clothes were wet our skin turned to ice.
    & Looking at the menu, we saw they had something on the menu called 'vegan sushi' and a 'vegan burrito'. 
    - "Whoa-" we thought, "Here? Vegan food? In the Marshalls?"
    & We liked this place already. We picked the lunch special, consisting of a rice and vegetable curry. I wondered what sort of vegetables they'd be putting into the curry knowing that Majuro didn't have a great variety. Before arriving, I'd read that most of the vegetables here are shipped frozen from either Hawaii or Guam. I've had the experience of buying previously frozen produce before and it's sad; the carrots rot within a day and the tomatoes taste like water. When buying vegetables, you've got to go when the ship's just arrived, or be willing to not buy certain items. This means i'll often choose potatoes, pumpkins or cabbage over peppers and fresh greens.
    & We ordered the curry anyway, it consisted mostly of black beans but had some tiny bits of pepper and cabbage; here in Majuro they use what they can get, and that the recipe varies from day to day. We really liked the food, even if the vegetable to bean ratio was off. With the meal - most important of all - we also ordered some bottom-less coffee, in an attempt at re-animating our freezing corpses. We drank many cups, colour returning to our flesh with every gulp - we are the revenants. 
  Customs office (again)
    & By the time we finished eating it was 2h10pm, I downed my last cup of infinite coffee and we cabbed back over to customs to get our paperwork done. When we arrived the office was still closed, with a line of fidgety customers waiting at the door - we too added to this line, equally annoyed and fidgety - mostly due to our caffeine intake. After 20 minutes, the doors opened and we hurried inside, presenting our papers to the first person we saw. We realized then that he spoke little english... 
    - "We want to check-in. We just arrived by boat."
    - "When you arrive?" he asked us.
    - "Today, we just arrived. We're on a boat."
    - "Boat? Okay. Show me your papers."
    - "Papers?"
    & We didn't know what papers he meant, but looking through our pile of paperwork he saw another set of clearance papers from Fiji which he took from us. He then asked us if we had papers from immigration for him - or at least, that's what we understood he'd said.
    - "No? They gave us nothing."
    - "When you arrive?" he asked again, I think he wanted to know the time rather than the date so we tried to give him everything he needed by saying it all again. We wanted to make sure he got all of the information down right.
    - "Today. At 10am."
    - "On boat..."
    - "Yes that's right. On a boat."
    & He took a note on it, along with our boat name, time of arrival etc. I wondered then if the reason we didn't get a paper from Immigration was because we hadn't truly 'completed' the entrance process, or if it was because he'd forgotten to give us a paper bound for the customs official; or maybe, again, we were misunderstanding something. The official then said "Ok."
    - "Ok? So it's done? Everything is ok?"
    - "Everything is ok." he repeated.
    - "We don't get a paper? A receipt or anything?"
    - "Everything is ok."
    & I groaned at this. I hate leaving governement offices without some sort of paper confirming the completion of an important exchange. Now we had no more clearance papers from Fiji, they'd taken those; no stamps in our passports, and no paper what-so-ever confirming that we'd checked in. I learned later, that this is just how it is in Majuro, unlike Fiji, you don't have endless stacks of papers to fill or documents to hold onto afterwards. At the time though, I didn't know this, used to over-the-top New Zealand bureaucracy. We exited the building then, with me freaking out...
    - "We don't have anything confirming anything!" 
    & Devine, being the stoic one, said calmly.
    - "They know we're here. We did sign that paper at Immigration - and he did take our clearance forms so we are in 'the system'. Tomorrow he'll stamp our passports and we'll be good!"
    - "He'll charge us extra." 
    - "Maybe he won't, you don't know that. Can't always think that what others have experienced are true again today, things change." 
    - "You're right, you're right."
    & Before we got to Fiji, people had told us really terrible things about it, about thievery and people boarding your boat at night. We've heard stories like that before, and never experienced it ourselves. This doesn't mean that they didn't happen, or that it can't happen, but it also shouldn't deter people from traveling there. We had an amazing time in Fiji, we befriended many locals too; if we'd listened to others we would have missed out on a beautiful country. Sometimes, you just have to take other people's re-tellings of a place with a grain of salt, don't form an opinion before having gone there yourself and even then, be open and don't judge. 
    & I hoped Devine was right though about the extra processing fees, I didn't want to pay them. Now, we headed back over to NTA to get our precious internet. They had our device, as promised, and we paid the required amount - finally, something simple. We had internet again! I was amazed at how fast it was, and was told it would work from the anchorage too. 
    % blog/majuro.4.jpg
    & We made it back to Shoreline, to the dinghy dock where Iggy was. Iggy looked a little deflated, but I attributed that to the cold weather. I pumped air back into the tubes and we motored back to Pino. The weather was really rough that night, and the next morning was no better. It was raining non-stop. Iggy was becoming a swimming pool and kept losing air, I had to go bail water out, and pump air into it every 3-4 hours to keep it afloat. 
  Iggy the sad dinghy 
    & Iggy the dinghy has been giving us a lot of trouble as of late, the problems started in Fiji after we left Savusavu; someone in Makogai gave us a tow, and caused the division between the two 2 air chambers inside to tear. This means that if there's a hole on one side, the other is affected; the two chambers are there to help keep you afloat and now we didn't have that anymore. That wasn't the only problem. The seams started to come apart, and that, is HARD to fix. While in Lami (Fiji), our kind NZ neighbours introduced us to a local who lent us a hard dinghy that we could use while getting Iggy patched up (a dinghy we nicknamed Tippy - you can guess why). We did manage to fix Iggy, and this fix lasted us till the end of our stay in Fiji; but after 3 weeks of being folded on deck, Iggy developed another bad leak. 
    & That morning, around 10 o'clock, Devine took our passports to shore with Iggy in the rain to meet the Immigration officer so we could get our passport stamped; then, maybe 30-40 minutes later, Devine returned, completely soaked with a deflated Iggy.
    - "Outboard stopped halfway, then Iggy began to lose air! Was adrift, and sinking, but came near a boat and shouted for help. The guy onboard gave me a tow to the dock, when we got there he said 'Your dinghy doesn't look sea-worthy'. No shit."
    & To make matters worse, Devine had gone to shore to meet the Immigration official for nothing because he was a no-show. It was probably for the best, we'd go back to the office on monday ourselves instead. 
    & This trip to shore revealed another serious air leak in Iggy. Back aboard, we took the outboard off in fear that it would sink with Iggy if it lost all its air. I climbed into our sad inflatable to assess the damage, one of the seams on the front left side was completely open, there was nothing I could do from the water and so we heaved Iggy back on deck. I bought some PVC glue back in Suva (Fiji) that we could use to mend it, but by now both of us were worried about riding this dinghy to shore. Every time we fixed it, a new problem would arise, another seam coming apart elsewhere... 
    & We weren't sure what to do, we were boat-bound with no means of getting to shore. When we left Fiji, we signed up to an email exchange group for those traveling to the Marshalls, and Karin from SY Seal sent us a message to welcome us. I sent her a message explaining our situation, and she promptly alerted her partner Cary. He came to see us the next day, and when Devine told him of our dinghy problems he offered to rent us a hard dinghy.
    % blog/majuro.2.jpg
    & This is the dinghy what we have been using since, a great fibreglass tender and better alternative to Tippy. We've been trying to repair Iggy in the meantime, doing our best to heal all its wounds but we know it won't last. At least we have some means of going to shore now, and this amazing hard dinghy just confirms our desire to have one for Pino in the future. Iggy just has to last us till Guam, after that, we won't need it in Japan (since no one anchors out).
  Conclusion
    & This concludes our entrance story into Majuro! We've since had our passport stamped. It took 2 days of going back and forth from boat to office. On the first visit, one of the officials was gone to the airport with 'the stamp' so the one in office asked us to come back some other time - yep, they've only got the one stamp. This is what life is like on these small islands, the officials that clear in foreigners in airports is often the same one that sits in office on normal times, either that, or only one of them has the 'authority' to check you in. Checking into the Marshalls in Majuro, we realized, is like playing a game of trying to catch them while they're in office, and making sure to refuse any offer to complete the process outside of regular hours.
    % blog/majuro.1.jpg
    & Clearing it wasn't great, but overall daily life here is good. The veggies are often rotten or scarce, but bananas are plentiful, and the restaurants are kind of great. There are lot of good Japanese and American products available, like Asahi beer and Lotus root snacks. The locals are amazing, understanding and kind; we've had a few laughs with the ladies that work at the ACE hardware after we caught them playing with some wind-up mouse toys. This ACE hardware is well furnished with electrical items that have our voltage (Pino is 110V); we bought a second fan for the boat there, something I wish we'd had for our last sweaty passage - lacking enough fans, we became 'puddle-people'. The internet here is great, we have a fast connection and can work from our floating office.
    & I forgot to say, but after getting back to Pino on the first day we made some savoury pancakes for dinner and it was the BEST.

  Sailing from Fiji to Majuro
    % blog/tuvalu.1.jpg
    & Here we go again, time for another passage. We left Fiji on {*October 23rd 2018*}, eager to spend some time on the water again. Our plan, was to stop by Tuvalu, maybe Kiribati, before arriving in Majuro in the Marshall islands where we'd be spending two months before moving off west to Micronesia. We left, knowing that this was wasn't going to be an easy ride...
    & Two areas of calms lie north of Fiji: the SPCZ (south pacific convergence zone) and the ITCZ (intertropical convergence zone). If you look at {windy(http://windy.com)}, hovering around the countries of {*Tuvalu*} and {*Kiribati*} are two bands of blue - blue means there is no wind. The size and location of these bands varies from day to day, week to week.. they phase in and out of existence with the weather and influence of the trade winds. 
    & Sailors fear these blue bands because the weather there is difficult, not only do you suffer calms, but also a continuous ballet of squalls and thunderstorms. We've been through the doldrums (the ITCZ) once already when we crossed from Mexico to the Marquesas.
    % blog/tuvalu.3.jpg
    & Why do some sailors fear being becalmed at sea? Before we made the pacific jump, some admitted carrying enough fuel to carry them across an ocean and that in quiet times they wouldn't hesitate to use the 'iron wind'. More recently, another couple we met told us this:
    - "You're just a sitting duck! Waiting for squalls to come at you!" 
    & Okay. Saying you're a sitting duck, implies that you're a thing with no protection against an attack or other source of danger. How is that true? Offshore sailboats are like mobile bunkers, besides, squalls last 20 minutes on average, just the time it takes for it to get past you, or for you to get past it. They hardly ever blow above 30 knots, you get wind out of it, and if you're reefed down properly (made your sail real small) and ready there's really nothing to fear! If really it is too much for you, you can always turn your back to it and run while it goes away, or heave to. These puffy beasts are hard to miss, their coming shouldn't be a surprise to you. 
    & We, sailors, are not sitting ducks, we are FRIGATE BIRDS and like them, we are fearless and can soar on wind currents. We catch every bit of air we can get to stay in flight, soaring and biding our time.
    % blog/tuvalu.2.jpg
    & We were looking forward to crossing paths with these impressive cloud formations again because we'd read of sailors making use of them to propel themselves onward on a quiet ocean, and this is exactly what we'd planned on doing. When we saw one we'd present the curve of our sails and stick out our thumbs.
    - "HEY! Over here! Come and pick us up!" 
    & Though if you're standing still, chances are the squall will pass you by...
    - "Hey sorry!" the squall would say. "I'm going this way. Sorry!"
    & As it went away, as did any hope of forwardness.
    & Sometimes we'd turn the engine on, to try and get ourselves moving to get in their way. We didn't make a habit of this, Pino is not a big boat and we don't carry much fuel aboard.
    - "Is this a good reason?" 
    & We'd ask ourselves. 
    - "Naw, better off bobbing on the water some more." 
    & The only times we did turn it on, was when the wind had just passed, leaving big waves in its wake. Not having wind to fill your sails on bumpy seas is a most irritating experience. The boat pitches and rolls as it gets tossed around, the sails flap as the mast swings like a mad pendulum - it feels like the boat is getting ripped apart and I too, feel like my patience is being torn away bit by bit. During such moments I curse and swear, my anger rises to dangerous levels and before I go full-on Godzilla I somehow gather sufficient mental clarity and cool to turn on the engine - when the boat is moving, the motion isn't nearly as bad and it's usually enough to calm me down. 
    % blog/tuvalu.4.jpg
    - "Fucking waves, fucking weather. AH- the hell with this LIFE! Fuck boats! FUCK the ocean...!"
    & Yup. Ocean times are not always pleasant. We do lose our cool from time to time... luckily, Devine & I are never angry or irritated at the same time, usually one is feeling good enough to work the other back into a good mood. 
    % blog/tuvalu.13.jpg
    & While becalmed on the water, there is no breeze and when near and around the equator let me tell you,  it is HOT. When we became mostly sweat, we'd go on deck and scoop up buckets of sea water to empty over our heads. Ahhh - lovely. Then, we'd spend the next hour picking bits of salt off our skin. Clothes were optional on this passage, whatever we'd wear just ended up soaked in body water within seconds. 
    & Being out there was more pleasant with a good breeze, which we would get every 3-4 days for 2 days. When downloading the weather, we'd always see a patch of blue coming into view ahead of us. 
    - "More bobbing times ahead." Devine would say. 
  Visitors
    & We did have some visitors to help distract us from the lack of weather, a pod of dolphins accompanied us for a while, and a masked booby came to land on the end of our boom one night. 
    % blog/tuvalu.8.jpg
    & I watched it, balancing itself with its feet and tail, it stayed there a while, then decided to land on the tiller as i was driving. My hand was on the end of that same tiller, just a short distance from it. I looked at the bird then...
    - "Are you serious? Is this where you want to be?" 
    & The large feathered nuisance didn't react.
    - "Really? Here?" I asked again.
    & The bird then took off, perhaps annoyed by my incessant glaring and came to sit on the top of the radar post instead. 
    - "Good" I said then. "That's a good place for you, you can stay there, but just so you know - the tiller is off-limits."
    & At this point I had good relationship with this bird, I liked having it around, but the love story ended when it began to shit in a torrential fashion. 
    - "Okay." I thought, "It's not that big a bird, it'll stop shitting at some point."
    & It didn't. 
    & Devine's shift started then, I went to bed, and when I woke up again I looked at the life raft, and our solar panel and was horrified at the sight of it all covered in drippy and stinky bird shit. 
    % blog/tuvalu.10.jpg
    - "It hasn't stopped shitting," Devine said, looking desperate and equally horrified. "I tried to shoo it off but it keeps coming back!"
    & Our guest had overstayed its welcome. I spent my entire shift shooing it off of the radar post by brandishing a cushion at it. It probably thought my attempts at getting it to leave were feeble, using a soft weapon and all, I didn't want to hurt it but did my very best to keep it from getting too comfortable. It would take off when it got too annoyed, then come back to try and land again, I'd shoo it off some more with the cushion, then it circled back around to land again... we did this for 2 hours, and then eventually it decided that this perch wasn't worth the trouble and sought a new one on Pino's bow on the pulpit rail. 
    % blog/tuvalu.5.jpg
    - "FINE!" I shouted. "Stay there!" 
    & At least we didn't eat, sleep or spend much time over there. 
    - "SHIT ALL YOU WANT! I DONT CARE!"
    & I did care though because this bird had outsmarted us, it had found a new place to shit aboard Pino. We named this bird Clippy, because it had a feather missing in one wing. We saw Clippy again later, hovering above us with another of its kin. We feared we'd get twice the bird poo if we allowed Clippy and its friend aboard... but they decided Pino wasn't very inviting and sought a more friendly float. 
    & Clippy wasn't our only visitor, when we left Fiji we left with 3 geckos. The first one we saw was in the mainsail as we hoisted it, we saw it scurry up the sail.
    - "No don't go up there! THERES NOTHING FOR YOU THERE" 
    & We yelled, fearing that it would fall overboard - it didn't listen, but it also didn't fall overboard because we found it again in the anchor locker.
    & The other two, we saw hiding in the dodger, they would come out when the sun was low and the temperature dropped to look for food. Pino did have some insects aboard; a real gecko buffet! This was an ideal arrangement, they get to stay, while they help rid us of bugs - good deal! Every evening, we'd wait for gecko hour, and watch them walk around the deck. Geckos make good boat pets. They're non intrusive, non destructive, they eat undesirables and are cute as hell.
  Change of plans
    & We had planned on stopping in Tuvalu in this trip, but we decided not to in the end. Why? Because the wind was good, and we just wanted to be out there. We had no desire to be back on land just yet. Crazy, we know. 
    - "So you want to be out there? Longer?"
    - "Um. Well. Yea! It's great! You can spend hours staring at the horizon daydreaming, planning future projects and brainstorming ideas for stories. There's no one around to disturb you, to tell you you have to do something else, no deadlines, no pressure either!"
    & So we went past it, taking advantage of the 3 days of good wind that was forecasted (in truth, it ended up being 2 good days, because weather forecasts in that area are just not very reliable). 
    % blog/tuvalu.15.jpg
    & The two good days though, did get us over to the first islands of Kiribati. Then, we were becalmed again, stuck between 3 islands with weak winds coming straight out of the north. We can't make good progress with winds coming out of where we want to go, so we'd tack west... than east, than west again. We'd sail between the same two points making no real progress at all. That day, i think we made 10nm northward. We got a text from Devine's dad.
    - "Slow day huh?"
    & We always feel a bit self-conscious about our progress, knowing people are watching and calculating the distance we make each day.
    - "Only 40nm?! Yeesh. Are you on a boat or a piece of driftwood?"
    & We did eventually get out of there, the wind fell back to the south east and we were able to make some good progress again. 
    & We don't always read, or spend time thinking on long passages, we also nap a lot ( in the beginning anyway). Devine ran out of podcasts early on, and had the idea of ripping the audio from films or series. We'd listen to the audio from Lost in translation, Howl's moving castle and 30 Rock while driving at night. I'd laugh alone in the dark, listening to conversations between Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy. 
    % blog/tuvalu.12.jpg
    & In the evenings, we'd wait for the moon to rise, or set, then one night we noticed a cheshire cat-like grin in the sky. 
    - "WHOA the moon is side ways! It's lit from the bottom!" Devine gasped.
    & We thought that maybe this was because we were at the equator, we still don't know what causes it, but it looked beautiful there... like a silver bowl, ready to collect the shooting stars that fall too near to it. 
    % blog/tuvalu.9.jpg
  Passing the equator
    & Pino and its crew had passed the equator back into the northern hemisphere. We sent a text to our parents then: "Hey! We're in the same hemisphere again!" The last time we crossed it was in march 2017, now, we'd done it again in November 2018 20 months later. 
    & When we arrived in the waters between Kiribati and the Marshalls, we began to feel more current pushing us from west to east, and saw large waves carrying refuse. Of all the time we've spent on the ocean, I've never caught sight of so much trash in the water. Every two minutes I'd spot a plastic bottle, some unidentified coloured container, styrofoam... and once, a long orange tube undulating in the waves. We hadn't seen another human in over 20 days but here were clear signs of their proximity.  I looked to my left and saw yet another floating piece of garbage. 
    - "Oh no wait it's a bird. OH nope - it's a bird sitting ON a piece of garbage." 
    & The bird was using a plastic bottle as a float, unlike me, the bird didn't give a shit about it being there. In fact, it seemed to think it rather convenient.
  Breakages aboard Pino
    & Pino Island we managed to keep relatively clean, our bit of personal trash compressed into bags. We take care of our home, although sometimes things do get messy and items do break. One of the slides on our mainsail broke off, leaving a big portion of the sail detached from the mast. This causes air to pass between the luff and the mast and disturbs the shape of the sail while putting more pressure on other slides and slugs (we have 4 battens in our main). We could see then that another slide was about to break, half of it had snapped off already and so we reinforced it and hoped it would get us to Majuro - it did. In fact, it broke off entirely just as we were tacking back and forth to the anchorage inside the lagoon. 
    % blog/tuvalu.11.jpg
    & This breakage, we believe, was due to us raising the main while not undoing the reef, a dumb, lazy and costly mistake that we've since corrected - I feel we're still learning how to sail. Don't think we're done making bad mistakes. We carry one spare slug in the boat, but we'll have to get others, or jury-rig something that can get us to Japan. 
  Sailing into Majuro atoll
    & Getting into Majuro was tough, we were on the east of the island, and had to pass between it and another at night in 25-30 knot winds. We were worried about the current running between the islands, but at least the island on the east shielded us against the worse of the waves. 
    & We arrived at the entrance to the lagoon at 8am, the waves at our backs with the wind coming out strongly out of the north-east. Throughout most of our trip, we had moderate winds, now, just as we were arriving we had the strongest blows of the trip. Our arrival into new countries is always boisterous. 
    % blog/tuvalu.7.jpg
    & Getting into Catalin pass was easy, it being well-marked and wide, the problem came after that; the main city lay on the easternmost point of the lagoon, we'd have to sail into the wind -  I did mention the wind was quite strong too didn't I? The town, as well as the anchorage, was 10 nautical miles away. This is nothing. We should have reached our destination under 2 hours but it took us about twice that time since we had to do long tacks to go forward. We were close-reaching, Pino handles that well enough most times but the problem today was the broken slugs in our main. We didn't like the shape of our mainsail, it was ballooning in weird ways, and that's when the slug for the upper batten broke off. We needed to keep the main up to go forward, the boat can't sail into the wind without a mainsail and our engine isn't strong enough to get us past these waves. Having to push something that is damaged past its limit is always worrisome, both of us fell quiet, eyes fixed on the top of the main.
    & Hold on Pino, we're almost there!
    & We tacked between the numerous large fishing and cargo ships anchored in the lagoon, hoping one of them wouldn't raise anchor and start to move; the last thing we needed was to start dodging moving targets. 
    % blog/tuvalu.6.jpg
    & At this point, both of us were tired. Exhausted. Neither of us felt like doing endless tacks... the skies were grey, squall clouds in every direction, winds gusting to high 30's at times. Devine was feeling pretty down by then, we were making progress, but it felt unending. As i said before, when one of us is low, the other by default is almost always in a good mood. I was being extra positive, trying to make a game of it, pointing out all of the weird and funny features of the ships we'd sail past.
    & We could hear locals chattering on the radio then, using CH16 to exchange pleasantries in Marshallese. It hit us then. After 24 days at sea... we're hearing people's voices! OTHER PEOPLE'S VOICES. This was real. Land was within reach! I looked ahead, and saw... MASTS! 
    - "Boats! Sailors...! MOORING FIELD! Which means PANCAKES!"
    & If you must know, we always have pancakes after arriving into a new country, it's our little tradition. We ran out of maple syrup in New Zealand, but we're still making em'! Now we dip them in pekmez (mix of tahini and fruit molasses) or do a savoury thing with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. 
    - "PANCAKES! PANCAKES!" 
    & We chanted as we moved into the mooring field. I hailed the local yacht club on the radio to ask about the moorings.
    - "Mieco Beach yacht club this is Pino! We've just arrived from Fiji!"
    - "Fiji? Good on you! Welcome to Majuro Pino!"
    & They told us that there were two mooring fields, one north and one south. We were heading towards the northern field, since it was closest to where we were...
    - "Pick up whatever mooring you can find!"
    & We did just that, spotting a free one behind an American yacht. All of the boats were American - makes sense, since the Marshalls is a US associated state. I picked up one of the moorings, its line thick with sea slime, algae and other marine growth and secured Pino to it. My hands smelled like fish, but no matter...
    & We. Are. Here. 
    & We forgot all the badness of the 4 previous hours, the tacking in shit conditions, our damaged slides and slugs, our salt-pickled bodies - all of that went away. We'd arrived. We made it. We sailed for 24 days without stopping, a trip almost as long as the one we did from Mexico to the Marquesas. Our arrival date, was {*November 15th 2018*}. 
    % blog/tuvalu.14.jpg
    & Like every other arrival, after many days at sea, we just wanted to lie down and sleep on a stomach full of pancakes... but no, we had to go ashore to check in. 
    & Ah - the irritating dealings with foreign immigration and customs officials! It is hardly ever pleasant, but this is another story in itself. A story of a sinking dinghy, confusion and endless cab rides, to be shared soon once the painful memories of it subside. 
    & **Update** I have since written a blog post about our arrival, it's called {(The Promise of Pancakes)}. You can also {watch the video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhxB_2YwPTY)} we made of our time at sea!

Leleuvia
  SETTINGS
    Location : Leleuvia, Fiji
    Date : 2018-09-05
  A tiny island
    % blog/leleuvia.1.jpg
    & We've never been on a tiny island, a place you can run the width of under just a few minutes. We found a place like this, {*Leleuvia*}, an island in the Lomaitivi archipelago in Fiji. 
    & This island went through many hands over the years, it now belongs to a resort that too bears the name of the island. We decided to make a stop there on our way to Suva, to wait for favourable winds to go south. 
    & Also, we wanted a taste of tiny-island living. 
    & We arrived at {*Moturiki pass*} around 1pm. SY Scoots gave us a number to phone the resort on arrival, so they could send a boat to guide us through the reef. We realized then, that our phone plan didn't include calls within Fiji, all we had was data — woops! That's ok! We still had the option of calling them on VHF. I hailed them repeatedly on CH10 — no luck. 
    & I had waypoints for the entrance, but not all the way to the anchorage. Many areas in Fiji aren't charted well, you can find yourself navigating over an area with the depth sounder reading "10m" but the chart will display a patch of green, an area too shallow to pass. It's always disconcerting, to find yourself anchored in a patch of green, like sitting in a negative space, a secret place that you didn't think existed. 
    & We got closer and closer to the green area, growing ever-so nervous, and continuing to try and hail the resort. Eventually, they picked up my call.
    - "Vessel calling, this is Leleuvia resort."
    - "This is sailing vessel Pino, d'you have any moorings available?"
    - "Yes. When you come near the pier we'll send a boat to escort you to it."
    - "Great, thanks!"
    & We wouldn't be entering the anchorage in the blind after all. We would have eyes to guide us to a safe spot. 
    & We motored on, nearing the pier, and spotted the escort boat. The driver came within shouting range, instructing us to follow, which we promptly did. They led us to a mooring, and assured us it was strong and that it could take our weight — not that Pino is heavy. We grabbed the line from the water, with a bit of difficulty, sometimes the mooring 'eye' for the buoys are submerged, and you need to figure out which bit to grab to get to it. We missed the mooring ball the first time, the whole endeavour was made worse by the up and down motion of the bow — there was a bit of swell coming into the anchorage from the north at the time. We rounded again to grab the mooring ball, i spied a thin loop at the top of the ball, and thrusted the boat hook in it. I hurriedly pulled the float out of the water, and my hands and the line found the mooring loop. This is not my favourite type of mooring ball, where you need to pull the ball up itself to find the rope hanging far underneath it, usually they'll put a separate float on the line to keep it buoyant. All moorings are different.
    % blog/leleuvia.4.jpg
    & The northerly swell would stop soon, the forecast called for 20-25kts out of the SE tomorrow. On the chart, the area looked protected from swell, with a reef belt around it, but looking around now, aside from the tiny spit of land that is Leleuvia, there was only water. At low tide the reef became evident, as the water receded sand banks came into view, fencing us in from all directions but from the North. Phew. The reef would break most of the waves, but at high tide some swell would make it past it for sure — not ideal, but we would have some protection.
    & The next day the wind did freshen, and as expected, at high tide the waves spilled into the anchorage. It was bumpy, but not overly so. 
    & Iggy still needed mending, I'd fixed some of the seams but not all. We didn't trust Iggy enough at this point to use Turnip (the outboard), imagine Iggy losing air and Turnip flopping into the water — what a disaster that would be. Without an outboard, we had little chance of making it ashore in an inflatable with broken oars, especially with all of this current. Plus the weather that day was all-around shitty, squalls came in succession, Pino danced with them in passing, until they drifted out of range. The rain came down hard. We could see land, but couldn't get to it.
    & The waves in the night kept us awake. I couldn't sleep, wondering if that mooring was as strong as they claimed it to be. I can now say that yes, that mooring is good and we stayed put. We were getting restless though, and even walks up on deck couldn't stop the twitch in our legs. The wind had died down, so we decided to call the resort on VHF to ask if they could pick us up — they were happy to do it.
    % blog/leleuvia.5.jpg
  The resort
    & The man dropped us off at the main pier, and we hopped onto land. It's weird to have the permission to come to a place like this, it feels exclusive, expensive and populated by tourists. It feels like we're cheating, as if we too should be paying something to be here. The mooring itself is free, although there is an unwritten rule about coming to shore at least once if you're on a mooring, to eat a meal at the restaurant, or have a drink. In this way, it pays itself.
    & The resort was composed of many separate facilities, with roofs of dried palm fronds kept up by thick logs. There were huts scattered all over the place, where the tourists stay. There was a dive shop, to rent diving or snorkeling gear, we even found showers that all can use (yes that means us too!). This resort was low-key, not overly expensive, which is kind of insane considering you need to take a boat to get here. It's far from everything, secluded — its own little country. And we're here, in it, for the price of a beer. 
    & Resorts in Fiji didn't used to be this way, in the past they could restrict access to the land and the water around them. Giving the rise in numbers of resorts in the country, Fiji instated a law that annuled these restrictions and that returned access to all — Fijians and visitors alike. Some sailors in countries like Canada seek these same privileges, requesting access to waters that are no longer accessible to them. With the rising trend in real estate prices, more and more people will seek alternative lifestyles like becoming a liveaboard. Space on water needs to remain accessible to all. 
    & In today's world, the 'right to anchor' is fantasy, widespread privatization of water and beach fronts is inevitable. If no one takes action, this will come to pass, groups in 'real-estate hell' cities like Vancouver are already taking a stand against this. Here's hoping they're successful, and that liveaboards will never suffer the woes of grid-living.
    & Back on Leleuvia, Devine & I took a quick walk around the facilities of the resort. We walked to a sandspit to the south of the island that extended far, even farther at low tide. The sand was almost white, near perfect, and the same could be said of the water — certainly not in terms of colour but of clarity.

  Circumnavigating by foot
    & We decided then to round this small island by foot. Most of the resort is concentated on the southern end, the rest is thick with trees, their arms reaching out and curling near the water. These arms carried families of terns, amongst them, some of the largest i'd ever seen, much bigger than the ones who came to sit on our pile mooring in Whangarei. The white, black-capped birds all took off as we came near, taking to the skies whilst cawking and screaming into the wind. Big slabs of coral bordered the water, flat and smooth, softened by centuries of wave caressing.
    & Blinded by the greenery and turquoise sea, we forgot to look at our feet, a striped snake drew near — hm, best look down every now and then. This island is very much alive, and writhing. 
    % blog/leleuvia.3.jpg
    & After our circumnavigation of Leleuvia, we paid our unspoken dues to the resort by having a drink at the bar. Then, we asked the dive shop if they could take us back to Pino. One of the workers at the shop gladly volunteered to take us, — eager for a break, no doubt. We boarded the boat with him, and motored on slowly as we shared stories. He told us he is an olympic athlete, racing polynesian canoes. He is very proud of this sport, his face lights up as he speaks of it. It's great to see younger Fijians taking interest in traditional sport, it is used less for transportaion nowadays, but I'm happy it exists in some form. We drifted past Pino, listening to his story, his goals... but we all returned to reality then, he kicked the engine into gear and brought us home. 
    & That night, we prepared Pino to leave, at sundown we raised the black moon.  We left the anchorage in the dark to make it to Suva at first light, with the waypoints recorded coming in, making an exit in little light was safe enough. 
    & This was a short text, befitting this small island. For more, {watch the video(https://youtu.be/WHuMwRRPqJo)} about our stay in Leleuvia.


Where is the turtle farm?

    Location : Makogai, Fiji
    Date : 2018-08-20
  Our time in Makogai
    % blog/makogai1.jpg
    & Pino spent a long time in {*Savusavu*}, but by then, we were growing tired of this scenery, not of the market, or of the company to be found here, but just of having that same view every morning. We love this city, but when it's time to go, it's time to go! 
    & We left our mooring at 9am, and moved along over to {*Cousteau's resort*} to anchor (16 48.623S, 179 17.331E). The water was unclear, and the clouded sky made it difficult to see bommies beneath us. Devine dove in and checked out our anchor, which was set in sand, and we weren't near any huge coral that we could see, that is, unless the wind shifted - it was hard to see that far in cloudy water to be honest.
    & SV Privateer arrived shortly after us, having made the short passage by sail, we saw them manoeuver around, looking for a place to drop the hook.
    % blog/makogai13.jpg
    - "What's the bottom like?" Lila shouted, baby Chance strapped to her back.
    - "Sand. A few bommies!" I shouted back.
    & They hovered around some more, opening the headsail, furling it, in and out again, and moving the main in and out to make their way around the anchorage. It's always impressive to watch, not many will rely on wings alone to do this. They'll do as many tacks as necessary to get where they need to go - engines be damned! 
    & We tried swimming at the beach that afternoon, but it was full of seaweed and unclear, we much preferred staying on the tiny slab of beach lining the shore to watch the hundreds of tiny hermit crabs moving about. They were different sizes, wearing a grand variety of shells - some spirally, others conical, stained with purples and whites, oranges and cream. We sat there in silence, listening to the sound of their shells rubbing against bits of broken coral. Such a pleasant sound, small scratching noises. Crkk, crkk... crkk. 
    - "Move along little ones - move along now! Tide's rising!"
    & We left our hermit crab friends behind, and went back aboard Pino. Tomorrow morning we had to get up at 4am to sail to Makogai (pronounced ma-kon-guy), 49NM away. 
    & The wind changed in the night, we could hear the chain rubbing against bit of coral, catching, before coming off again with a jerk, the sound traveling to us by the chain through the hull. We should have probably buoyed the chain, we thought then, but it was dark, and too late to think of doing this now. Hopefully, the chain wouldn't have this macramé thing going on with the bits of coral down there. 
    % blog/makogai5.jpg
  No more windlass
    & We awoke to a dark night, the alarm ringing at 4am, as planned, and realized then that our windlass didn't work anymore. I recently undid the connections to clean bits of rust off, I thought maybe I didn't put them back in right, when I went inside to check everything was good and tight, but something was wrong with the windlass motor: a screw was sticking out of one end.
    - "That - is not good."
    & I reached for it, and was able to pull it out with ease, it was a long screw, attached to some thin metal rod, which had cracked off of something. I've little experience with this and could see the connections were good yes, but the motor was not- definitely not, bits of metal aren't supposed to crack off, that I was certain of. There is power, solenoid is good, but if we try and work the switches all we hear is this dull mechanical sound. 
    & Luckily, we make a point of always anchoring under 40 feet, and we haul the anchor up by hand most times. Devine was able to get the anchor out, happy to see the chain wasn't stuck in coral after all. We motored off, since the wind was mostly dead - although I feel Privateer somehow would have found puffs of air to do it - and went out of the reef. There was a bit more wind outside the protective belt of shallows, and after raising the main and unfurling the jib we sailed on forward - slowly, but forward.
    % blog/makogai6.jpg
  Pino sails to Makogai
    & We had much rain, in fact, it started to pour everytime I put my hand on the tiller. Rekka, rain magnet extraordinaire. 
    & When the sun came up, the clouds too, dispersed and disappeared, both of us boiled under it, reddening in the fews places we'd forgotten to protect, like, behind the knees, or in the gap of skin where the shirt ends and pants begin - oh, and the tops of our fingers too.
    % blog/makogai12.jpg
    & We arrived to {*Makogai*} just around 2h30pm, and entered using the western passage.
    & {*Waypoints*}:<br> Entrance to pass 17 26.824'S 178 54.555E<br>Mid pass 17 26.921S 178 54.927E<br>Anchor spot 17 26.480S 178 57.201E (~35feet).
    & We found a spot, our anchor set down there well enough, few small corals, but one especially large one lay right behind us everytime our boat would swing to the north. It was deep enough, and the prevailing winds kept us off it most times, there was no danger of our chain snagging in it either - all good! We wanted to anchor right of the pier, in shallower waters, at first, but there was a mooring there so we didn't try. 
    & I was excited to be here, because I'd read they were raising giant clams, and there was a turtle breeding centre - a turtle farm! If you've read my other blog entries, you know how excited we get about turtles. 
    & Tur-tle farm! Tur-tle farm!
  Sevusevu
    & Tired and sun-baked, we went to bed early. We knew we'd have to go ashore to do {sevusevu(http://www.fijiembassy.be/index.php?page_in=yaqona)}, a practice done in all of the Fijian villages here, that consists of presenting a {yaqona root(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fijian_traditions_and_ceremonies#Yaqona)} to the chief and of taking part in a kava drinking ceremony. Sevusevu is a way of welcoming you to the island, this is how the chief gives you permission to anchor here, and to walk on the island. For the ceremony, the chief pounds the dried kava root into a fine powder, straining and mixing it with cold water. The chief will recite some text in Fijian, then cups his hands, claps three times and begins to serve the grog. The grog is drunk from a bilo, a half-shell of coconut. Everyone in the room takes part in this. 
    % blog/makogai11.jpg
    & We decided we'd go and do sevusevu, and the turtle farm visit, tomorrow morning instead, don't think we could have survived an evening of Kava.
    & The next day, I brought Iggy back to life, and Devine and I decided to row it to shore. Neither of us felt like putting the outboard on, we needed the exercise anyway, so we each grabbed a paddle and off we went! I was carrying our gift of yaqona root in a bag. The sailboat Scoots was anchored in deeper waters behind us, and came powering in with their dinghy, asking if we wanted a tow to shore. We figured why not - to hell with exercising, it's too damn hot anyway and we're crispy enough as is. We threw them a line so they could pull us along. 
    % blog/makogai7.jpg
    & Just off the pier, there were 3 Fijian men working hard on a project. They were building additional concrete basins for their clam operation. Makogai has a giant clam farm, these mollusks are endangered - because that's what ALWAYS happens when humans decide animals are delicious. It's a shame really, considering they're centenarian creatures. It's also sad to think that if they're numbers go up, people will almost certainly start eating them again. 
    % blog/makogai8.jpg
    & The locals here in Makogai grow them in basins, with water pumped up into the long concrete basins from Dalice Bay using pumps through long pipes. When big enough, they carry the clams back out to the water. These things can grow absurdedly large, up to 129cm across, and and can weigh up to 200kg! We stared at them, bathing in the basins, they stared back at us, grin creepily with their undulated lips.
    % blog/makogai8.jpg
    & Devine neared one of the locals, to ask THE question, the only one that matters...
    - "Where's the turtle farm?"
    & The local shook his head.
    - "No more turtle farm."
    & Heartbreaking.
    - "What? Aw! Nooo-"
    & So that's that. No turtle farm today, not ever. 
    & Vandy and Eric from SY Scoots had been to Makogai for about 5 days, they pointed out the person we would need to talk to for sevusevu. The man was working on the concrete basins, shiny with sweat, he walked over, and welcomed us to the island.
    - "Bula! Bula!"
    - "You're the chief of the village?" we asked.
    - "No, no-" he said, shaking his head.
    - "-no chief here, not anymore, but I will speak for the island today. I will do your sevusevu. Follow me, we will do it over there."
    & The man was in work clothes, speckled with grey stains from working with cement, he had little teeth in his mouth, but smiled a whole lot. He brought us to a shaded area, under a set of covered roofs, with a black sheet of fabric laying on the ground. We arrived there, and he took a seat on the sheet.
    - "Sit, sit - please!"
    - "We keep our shoes?" 
    & We asked, determined not to offend him, or anyone else here. 
    - "Shoes are ok, hats are ok, everything is ok! Please sit. You have camera?"
    - "Yea, we've got one."
    & We said yes, although this wasn't exactly picture-worthy, and had no plans to take any shots. Already then, we knew this wasn't going to be a proper sevusevu, this man, and the others around, were too busy today to do it.
    & We took a seat, and handed over the yaqona root. The man took it, and began to recite the traditional monologue, it ended with a chant, and three claps.
    & CLAP! CLAP! CLAP!
    & We understood nothing of course. The man could have been saying complete gibberish for all we knew.
    - "Turtle beard, turtle beard. Glamour pickles, nubs, glassy and dressy. A poultry feeling, triangular trouts at the gathering of the goose. Bright blubbery bits."
    & Bright blubbery bits everyone. Bright, blubbery, bits. Cobo 3 times, drink the grog.
    & We sat there, as the man did his thing, in his tattered clothing, pretending to have a bilo in his hands, knocking on the ground 3 times. All in all, we sat there for 5 minutes. 
    - "You are now welcome to the island! Yes, yes, welcome! There is nice walk that way, leading to a school."
  The internet benc
    & We thanked him, and then we were off, eager to stretch our legs! About 20 minutes into the walk, we heard a 'hello!' over our heads. Vandy waved at us from a high perch, standing on a ledge overlooking the foot path.
    - "Want some internet? Here's the only place you can get it."
    & Devine and I moved over to check it out. We climbed off a muddy slope, and arrived to a place with a ratty-looking bench, and white ash everywhere on the ground beneath it. 
    & Eric was sitting on the bench, eyes on his cell.
    - "Welcome to the internet bench!"
    & Here, was the only place near our anchorage that offered a good signal, you get it from a tower on an island just south of here (Wakaya island). We've tried elsewhere, and nope! Want to tweet? You have to go for a 15 minute jungle walk, then climb up a small slope to do it. This is no worse than us raising the phone up the mast with a halyard, for a better connection.
    % blog/makogai3.jpg
    & We hadn't brought our phones, because we didn't expect to find a signal anywhere on the island. No matter, this was a vacation of sorts, a vacation away from internet. Together, we walked down the path leading to the school, some ways away. Vandy would pause ever now and then, binoculars at the ready.
    - "Hear that?"
    & I listened. A bird, with a distinct sound, not anything ive heard before.
    - "Been trying to spot it since I've been here."
    & We never did find out which bird made that sound, it eluded us, hiding in the foliage and moving whenever we came near. We did see many little lizards though, scurrying away as we walked past, taking shelter in the bush. We saw other abandoned buildings from the former leper colony, apparently they kept the chinese, indo-fijians and fijians lepers apart, and the women from the men too, which explained why there were so many buildings scattered about. Crazy to think that even in times of disease, the segregation of people is still a thing.
    % blog/makogai2.jpg
    & We didn't make it to the school, it was too hot out, and it was nearing lunchtime. The four of us made our way back to our dinghies.
    - "You want to come over for Gin later?" 
    & Vandy offered. We will never, ever, refuse such an offer, especially if it means we can get cold drinks! Ah! Ice. A thing of luxury. Vandy and Eric make their own gin, using cheap vodka, and adding juniper berries, coriander seeds, lime zest and cardamom pods. It's brilliant. It also works to make cheap gin, into better-tasting gin! 
  Gin? Gin!
    & {*Ingredients*}:  <br>5 TBSP Juniper berries, 2 TBSP whole coriander seeds (crushed), 4 cardamom pods (crushed, add 1 per day) and about 2 TBSP of citrus zest.
    & {*Instructions*}: <br> Full recipe calls for 1.75L bottle of vodka plus another bottle large enough to hold the infusion, and eventually the entire 1.75L of gin. Crush the coriander, zest the lemons or limes. Add all ingredients except cardamom pods to half of the 1.75L of vodka. Add Cardamom pods, crushed, a day later. Let sit for 6 more days. Strain through a coffee filter, or other material to remove solids. Add remaining vodka, the gin won’t be clear, but it tastes fine! You can also do this to cheaper gin, to make it into super tasty gin!
    - "SO for tonight - say, 5' oclock? Gin o'clock?" 
    - "YESSSS! Works for us!"
  The dinghy problems begin
    & Scoots offered to tow us again, and once more, we said yes. But when they pulled us this time round, I heard a a loud POW sound. Then, the tube I was sitting on began to deflate.
    - "Uh oh."
    & Devine looked at me, noticing I seemed to be fusing with Iggy, getting lower and lower, and nearer to the water with every passing second.
    - "Iggy's looking a little flat." 
    & Devine noted. I tried to sit 'less' on it, leaning in the middle instead. We arrived then on Pino, my side near flat. We climbed onto the big boat, thanked Scoots, and then watched Iggy continuing to lose air while in the water. We were glad then that we didn't try to put the outboard on, that would have made Iggy lose air a lot quicker, not to mention, it puts the outboard at risk of taking on water. It's hard to sink an inflatable, even a deflated one, but still, having an outboard, and us in it probably wouldn't have helped much.
    & We pulled Iggy up on deck, to try and find the problem. It was clear to us then, there were no holes, but the seams had come apart in a few places. The glue had gone - from UV exposure we think - and the strain of being pulled by Scoots ripped them open - the final blow. Our dinghy is PVC, it was an inexpensive Plastimo dinghy that we got back in BC. It probably would have faired well enough if we'd stayed there, but no, we've been sailing in warm areas and this model just wasn't built for it. Our budgets at the time, didn't permit us to get a Hypalon dinghy, also, we just didn't think there was that much difference between the two materials. Inflatables look damn sturdy when new, hard to imagine seams coming apart, they look indestructible. 
    & Our Iggy did not look so indestructible now, poor thing. 
    % blog/makogai10.jpg
    & I lost the original patch up kit from Plastimo, on a bumpy dinghy ride in San Francisco. We'd found a backup kit in a used yacht gear shop in Alameda, that came with a brush, patches and glue. I found the kit, but the glue was just a white tube, with no instructions what-so-ever - great. I've never done a repair like this before, and we don't have the internet to turn to for tutorials. I just went ahead, cleaned the area, and tried to glue the seams as best I could. 
    & Then, I let it dry, and later tried sitting on various places to see if more air would escape. It seemed good, and we took it for a ride to shore to test it, no problem still, but I brought the patch-up kit and air pump just in case. We went for a short walk on the beach with the intention of bringing Iggy up to a diving spot, near giant clams some ways away. After our walk, we returned to the dinghy to find one side had collapsed again.
    - "Damn it Iggy!"
    & We put Iggy back in the water, and pumped air back into the tube, and sat in the center, with Devine sitting on the backboard at the stern. We did our best to avoid sitting on the tubes themselves to discourage the air from coming out again. We were rowing to Pino, with air gradually leaving the tubes. Devine was trying to row an inflatable with broken oar locks forward, while I was busy pumping more air into Iggy as we went along. Our dinghy has seen better days. For a moment I feared we'd have to swim back to the boat, Iggy in tow, but we made it back, and again, watched as our inflatable friend lay limp in the water, like an old, disused, party balloon. 
    & The glue did work in some areas, but seeing as how there were no instructions on the packaging and that we didn't have internet I couldn't be sure if i'd really done it right. We pulled Iggy back up on deck, and rolled it up. It didn't look like we'd be doing any trips back to shore, shame, really did want to see those giant clams in the water. Also, Scoots was anchored much further down, in deeper waters, don't think Iggy the dinghy could make that trip.
    & Devine called them on the radio then.
    - "Hey, we've got a bit of an Iggy- uh, dinghy problem. Think you could come and pick us up later?"
    - "Sure, sure! Sorry to hear about your dinghy."
    & Later, around 5'oclock, Eric came to pick us up in a large dinghy and matching 15HP outboard. Getting into a dinghy like that is a lot of fun, it has a hard bottom, lots of power and will definitely get you places fast!
    - "You want to see fast?" 
    & Eric said with a grin, right before we pushed off Pino at incredible speeds.
    & I laughed, as we powered along. Speed always makes me laugh, it's an uncontrollable sort of laughter, a mix of joy and fear. We saw Pino get small, real fast, and Scoots got big, real, real big, real, real fast. The boat is 50 feet, and damn gorgeous.
    & We had a lovely night, always great to meet fellow cruisers, everyone is just so different and lovely in their own way. 
    & We were leaving the next day, Vandy radio'ed us early in the morning, just a quarter to 7.
    - "I've packed up some Juniper berries for you! How do I get em to you?"
    - "OH! Wow thank you! I guess we can just pass real close on our way out and you can toss it over?"
    - "Yea we'll try that, I'll try to weigh it down with something so the wind doesn't catch it."
    - "Sounds good, see you then."
    & Surely enough, 15 minutes later, we motored past, and Eric threw a generous bag of juniper berries. It landed on the dodger - good aim!
    - "Catch you out there!"
    & We shouted. Eric had a large shell in his hands, and blew hard into it. {*FUUUUUMP!*} A way of bidding us farewell. We'd noticed then that another yatch we'd met yesterday had drifted way back into the anchorage. The wind had picked up in the night and they'd dragged anchor, luckily, the water in the entrance was shallower and their anchor got caught in it.
    & We'd heard the sound of a horn, late in the night, but didn't know what it was and our tired minds did not think of looking to find out its source, or why it had been sounded in the first place. 
    & We motored past the boat on our exit.
    - "Morning! You guys okay?"
    - "Yes yes!" they said.
    & It was hard to hear them, because of the wind. 
    - "Did you *something something* horn last night?"
    & I thought they'd asked if we had HEARD the horn, and so I answered:
    - "Yes!".
    & I said this, thinking she'd explain, because I too wanted to know what that was about! 
    - "Thank you so much!" they said, smiling.
    & Woops, I realized my mistake then. They probably asked me, if we had sounded the horn last night, and I'd taken credit for it. The story was that Scoots, kept anchor watch at night, when the wind picked up, and they saw the boat was further away in the anchorage. Scoots blew the horn in the night, so they would hear, and maybe find out that they had moved some ways away from their original location. When you're far away, and no radio contact, this is a good way to wake people up. 
    & Very happy to say that we didn't move at all in the night, we have our new heavier anchor to thank for that. 
    & We hoisted the sails, and Pino moved out of the reef, heading southward, towards our destination: {*Leleuvia*}, a small island south of {*Ovalau*}.

PINO, PROJECTS AND PAIN  
  SETTINGS
    Location : Whangarei, New Zealand
    Date : 2018-06-02
  Introduction
    % blog/nz2.haulout.4.jpg
    & We arrived in New Zealand with a long, scary list of things to fix, or replace on Pino: New batteries, new mainsail, bottom-paint, galley plumbing, replace intermediates and backstay, replace top hatch, replace windows, replace control cables... etc, etc...
    & If we can't finish all of these projects then we can't leave, that was the deal. There is too much ocean between us and Japan, our vessel needs to be made safe to endure it and to ensure our safe passage. 
    & We had grand ideas about what we thought we could do, of doing everything ourselves - to learn, but also to save money. 
    & Below, is a detailed account of all the repairs and changes we did on Pino, and of the difficulties that came with it. This is a technical post, interspersed with bits of story, present and past. For those who don't know the terms, but that are interested I'll do my best to explain them all throughout the text.
  BATTERIES
    % blog/nz2.batteries.1.jpg
    & About a month after we arrived, our batteries went flat in the night. Completely dead. We heard the inverter beeping, complaining it didn't have enough power to function. 
    & That woke us up. 
    & We were expecting this. The batteries were not performing so well these days, or even in the last year. There were times when we had to start the {portable generator(liveaboard)} to get the engine going, especially early in the mornings when the power from the solar hadn't kicked in yet. Not just this, once we did have the engine on, for a while we had no more alternator belts and so no way to charge the batteries with it. An alternator is used to charge the boat batteries with the engine. Our alternator is too big for our engine (previous owner upgraded it) and if we run the engine too hard with the alternator on, the belt breaks. We broke 3 in one month. We were in French Polynesia at the time, and could find no replacements where we were (we did find some eventually in Rarotonga). 
    & After our batteries died in Whangarei, we went to {*Snow brothers*}, a car battery store, to ask if they had four 6-volt batteries in stock - they did. Except the batteries were a bright red colour, with a big American flag on the front tag - the golf-cart batteries of patriots. 
    & We went for the same battery setup as before, we'd need more power than this but don't have the space for it. We opted for lead acid again (the cheaper sort), they work fine, but we'd prefer something more eco-friendly, and with a longer lifespan. 
    & We bought the batteries, and Snow Brothers offered to deliver them at the marina, and to pick up our old ones to dispose of - great! Back on Pino, we unhooked all the cables, and lifted the batteries from their restraining boxes. The batteries were bloated, the sides had a curve to them. Yep. These batteries were done, sulphated, and beyond help.
    % blog/nz2.batteries.2.jpg
    & We put one in an old milk crate we had, and lowered it into the dinghy - with much care - and did the same for the other ones, carrying two at a time. Iggy has a soft floor, wasn't up to carrying more than that at once I don't think.
    & They took our dead batteries, and we returned the new ones to the boat, again, in teams of two. One of the Snow Brothers employees gave us a handle, so we could move them with ease, this helped a lot to get them back onboard. We hooked them up, and Pino was sentient again. 
    % blog/nz2.batteries.3.jpg
    & {*Takeaway*}: Don't forget to water your wet batteries, we didn't do this so often in the beginning (knowing nothing about boats or batteries). They'll last a lot longer than ours that way. 
    & {*Batteries*} 810$<br>{*Total*} 810$
  SOLAR PANELS
    % blog/nz2.solar.1.jpg
    & I noticed one morning an ad on the marina's bulletin board, concerning a set of two 90W panels for sale, for 150$. We knew we wouldn't get a better deal than this, and so we went to get them. 
    & The owner was upgrading to bigger panels, because boats nowadays require more power, to keep up with power-hungry electronics. How else can you power two fridges, a microwave and your ice crusher? The solution is MORE power. We get the hand-me-downs - it's how most people our age get boats.

    & We removed the 60W panel we had on the forward deck of the boat, it was too exposed to spray, a bad idea overall. We didn't install this panel again since we had no place for it. We moved the 100W from the bimini top (the open front canvas top over the cockpit, supported by a metal frame) to the dodger (the spray hood above the cabin), and the two 90's on the bimini rack. Now, instead of 160W, we had 280W. 
    & {*Takeaway*}: Don't install panels too low on your boat, or somewhere waves can wash over them. Also, if you're going to install panels over the cockpit have a proper arch made (if you don't already have one). We recently removed the two panels from the bimini rack, because it wasn't made for that, and we feared it would collapse under strain (wind 40kts+). As of now, we only have the 100W on the dodger, and with a 90W set up on the aft-most seat under the tiller, the other 90W is inside when we're underway and we put it out on deck when we're at anchor. The panels we bought are too big and too heavy for our boat, it was a good deal and it helped power Pino for 1 year, but for offshore passages it's just not ideal. Having an arch built is possible, but Pino is a light race boat, and adding more windage and weight will reduce performance. SO, as of now, we're undecided.

  WINDOWS and HAUL OUT
    % blog/nz2.windows.1.jpg
    & One of the scarier projects on our list was to replace our windows, Pino has 3, on each side, they have a lot of surface and a bit of a bend to them. We had to do this right, to avoid redos or potential leaks. People warned/lectured us about this, it has to be done right. Whenever we mentioned to someone we were re-doing our windows, they almost always gave us their opinion, and what they thought was the best way to do it. Suddenly, everyone's an expert. Can't say how many times we've had people tell us what to do, this, without us ever asking it of them. All boats are different, not everything that has worked for them will for work for us. 
    & When came time to start this dreaded project, our first decision was to cut the aft-most window of the boat in two, the longest of the three, with part of it overlapping a fibreglass backing. Our old windows both cracked in that place. The boat twists as you sail, and with heat or cold, the acrylic contracts and expands, the sealant helps to cushion the motion. 
    & Another big change, was to make the windows thicker, from 6mm to 8mm acrylic. Our thinking was that added thickness too, would aid in them not breaking as easily. I cannot yet vouch for the quality of that decision, as we have not traveled with them long enough to ensure it was the best idea. More updates on that to come.  
    & We intended to buy sheets of material, to then cut it ourselves but lacking the space, and the tools - as well as time - we decided to have the windows cut to size with {*Seamac*}. We visited the shop, and the quote Bonnie, one of the owners, gave us for the material and cutting was good enough, so we went ahead with it. (Unfortunately the price did go up considerably, more on that ahead.) 
    & We had no real technique for removing the window. It's a shitty job, that involves cutting the silicone sealant with a long blade, then, to prise the window from the seal with a lever (we had a wood knife. Not ideal), while cutting through the silicone with the blade as we went along. I read somewhere, that using a wallpaper scraper works well, as a lever. Don't use a wood knife, or a screwdriver, don't be like us. Oh, and be gentle, SO, so gentle. 
    & Don't let your anger for this window grind you down, do it slow, do it well. 
    & Our lack of gentle-ness, resulted in the window cracking in many more places. Our windows have a LOT of sealant - there is no outer frame or screws for support, just the gooey stuff. The part of the window overlapping the fibreglass backing gave us the most trouble: a 25x30cm area, thick with black stuff, jamming a knife through that was tough, didn't have a blade that long or that strong to pierce it all the way through.
    % blog/nz2.windows.2.jpg
    & Removing them took many hours, laid over many days, the weather was rarely on our side, and so we decided to only remove the starboard side windows, and to use these as a template for both sides - this too, turned out to be a mistake. The windows may look the same, but they are not. They are very much, asymmetrical. We didn't want to remove both sides at once, because it was raining a whole lot, and because we live and work in the boat and wanted to be comfortable. 
    & I had tarps taped up on the starboard side, to cover up the windows at night against both rain and insects. If we'd removed both sides at once, I think we would have had a hard time living in Pino, especially since the work took at least 3 weeks, this, including the time it would take for Seamac to cut the windows - they were very, very busy at the time.
    & Once we had the windows off, we taped up the broken pieces together, and brought them over to Seamac, already then, well aware that they wouldn't be able to use them as templates. They would have to re-draw new ones, adding to the production time and cost (and so begins the long line of added costs). We only have ourselves to blame for this, because we had little help and few resources, and because we're learning. 
    & The windows had need of a black primer, applied to a band on the inside of the window, on the part that would be in contact with the sealant and the fibreglass. While protecting the silicone from the sun, it also makes for a nicer, cleaner finish. They did this step for us too. Seamac also applied a protective film to the surface of the acrylic, in two layers (leaving one to protect the inside part of the window, to be removed last). The quote was 350$ initially, but in the end, it cost us about 1100$, for the material, cutting, black primer, 13 tubes of silicone sealant and templating. 
    % blog/nz2.windows.4.jpg
    & In hindsight, we should have sought help for removing the windows, we wouldn't have required templates if we'd done it right, which would have reduced the costs significantly. We did have help for the second half of the project though, having a mentor helped us do it right.
    & While waiting for the acrylic to be ready, we scraped all of that black stuff off. It took ages to do it. We had razor-blade scrapers to take off the rough bits, then we sanded the edges by hand, and then borrowed someone's sander to smooth it off, while helping to create a rough surface for the sealant to adhere to. Once the surface was devoid of black stuff, many long hours and days later, we cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol. While giving the surface a good clean, it doesn't leave it wet, it evaporates quickly which is essential for bonding. 
    % blog/nz2.windows.3.jpg
    & It took a lot of time for our windows to be finished, and this coincided with our haul-out at Dockland 5. 
    & Pino needs a bath, real bad. 
    & {*Take away*}: In doubt when doing a difficult project, seek help from others, don't hesitate to do that, it'll save you time and trouble down the line. Pick your weather, be patient and don't rush it, if you do it right you'll only need to do it once (until comes time to do it again, but that should be many more years later).  
  HAUL OUT
    % blog/nz2.haulout.0.jpg
    & I feared this moment, of seeing what the hull was like after spending a few months in the Town Basin. Our bottom paint was old, and staying in these hot brackish waters probably didn't help. We'd heard New Zealand waters were... nutritious - I had no idea just how much. 
    & The day that we scheduled our haul out, was also the day when tropical storm Gita passed near New Zealand. Northland was safe, but we got a lot of the wind and rain. We motored off of the pile mooring with ease, our prop wasn't fouled - good. I had nightmares about us not being able to move, the prop heavy with ocean stuffs, with us losing control and drifting onto other boats, then onto the canopy bridge with the concrete grinding into our mast. Prior to leaving, people had told us stories of boats not being able to move because of all the shit caked under their boats. 
    & Pino skidded on the water well enough, and we made it to {*Dockland5*}. We did have some difficulty steering the boat onto the slings, given the weather. The wind screamed into our rigging.
    & Upon seeing Pino out of the water, we gasped. Pino's belly was full of brown clammy bits, forming a thick shell, a disgusting crust of sea things. 
    & Pino, better known now as 'The Flying Dutchman', at least, on its underside. Any moment now, a human-like shape, a clam for a head, would detach itself from the hull and go on a walkabout while chanting.
    - "Part of the crew, part of the ship!"
    & All of that crusty brown stuff came off with the help of a pressure hose, but also with it, came big sheets of paint - whoops, old paint is old.
    & We had some rain on that first day, as the tropical storm passed on through, but luckily, this did not last. We stayed in the yard for 8 days, and most were sunny, permitting us to redo the bottom without any need to wait for weather. We borrowed a vacuum sander from Cowley's, a hire shop for tools and other heavy equipment. Cowleys was some walk away and the vacuum was heavy, it had wheels, but the road leading back to the yard had no sidewalk and part of the walk was on a narrow bridge. Someone from the store agreed to drive us there, good, don't think the vacuum would have survived the trip otherwise. 
    % blog/nz2.haulout.1.jpg
    & Back over on Pino, we laid sheets around and began to vacuum sand. This was our second ever haul out, second time doing bottom paint. The first time, we wet-sanded by hand - a long and back-breaking process. Wet sanding wasn't permitted here, because boatyard doesn't have separate drains for toxic paints. The only spot, is where they do the pressure wash near the ramp. 
    % blog/nz2.haulout.2.jpg
    & Sanding took us about 2 days, light till dark. Because Pino's belly had spots without paint - a lot of the old stuff had cracked off - we decided to apply a primer first. Putting anti-fouling paint on gel coat (what protects the fibreglass underneath) directly is unadvisable. Anti-fouling paint is what you cover the bottom of your boat with, to slow the growth and/or facilitate detachment of marine organisms, like barnacles, or algea. If you didn't have this, you'd have to wash your boat very, very often, otherwise you'll get a nice marine garden under there. We used an ablative paint, which means that the paint comes off over time. Usually, adding 3 coats of paint is enough.
    & After a few layers of primer, and when dry, came time to apply the anti-foul paint. We bought one big can of black {*Carboline*} antifoul, one can was enough to do 3 coats. 
    % blog/nz2.haulout.3.jpg
    & Drying time can be long between coats, we took this time to do other jobs on the boat, like, replacing the plumbing for the galley (our boat kitchen) sink. In Canada, and all the way to Mexico, we were using our salt water pump in the galley, and unfortunately, in warmer waters, it caused the inside of the sink drains to corrode. We had to replace those, but removing the drains meant disconnecting the pipes below, which in turn revealed some pretty nasty stuff. 
    % blog/nz2.drain.1.jpg
    & The pipes were clogged, and old - overall disgusting. So. What started as a drain-replacing project, turned into a galley sink overhaul. We spent much time at {*Mitre10*}, laying pipes out on the floor, to find the right-sized elbows and tubes.
    - "Okay. Drain head, goes to lock joint, which goes to tube, upsized to a another, bigger joint, to a another tube, to an elbow, to another tube..."
    & We had a nice puzzle thing going on, an exploded view of our future sink setup. Employees in the store stood around us, helping us find the correct parts.
    & Passing pliable pipes through floors and narrow gaps is always tough. We taped the end of the pipe to the new one and pulled, hoping it wouldn't come apart in the process. Do it slow, so slow, otherwise you're FUCKED. Being gentle and patient is a common tactic when it comes to boat projects. 
    & We also replaced the galley faucet. The boat had a pressure faucet before, but we didn't use it, because we prefer to use the foot pump - more economical you see. Every press is a 1/4 cup of water. We removed the pressure faucet, as well as the old foot pump faucet that came through inside the sink (which had also begun to leak). We installed our new faucet head between the two sinks, in the place of the old one, and plugged up the hole the foot pump faucet left behind. We opted for a simple model, because the more extravagant, heavy duty one with a pumping handle didn't fit in that space vertically - shame. 
    & When that project was over, came time for another bottom coat. We interspersed waiting times with other projects, which made our days quite long. We always went to bed exhausted. Our boat was still windowless then, and messy from other ongoing fixes, it was tough to really do anything other than boat stuff. Our laptops were put away, orphaned, and confused.
    & Pino looked amazing with a fresh bottom and with a clean waterline, we cleaned up some oxidation stains with some {*Grunt*}- that stuff works wonders.
    & We also cleaned the prop thoroughly, it had lost some of its shine, not just this, we discovered then that we had to grease the thing. It hadn't been greased in some time. Being new to boats, there are some things that people won't think to tell you, and that we, won't ever think to ask. Although while cleaning it, I did notice a place with a bolt, with the word 'grease'. Um. Odd, I thought. Grease - Grease what?
    - "The prop obviously. How did we miss this?" Devine said
    - "Because the prop has never been this clean?"
    - "Merde."
    - "Kinda like that time we found out that we had to water our batteries. Yea. Kinda like that."
    & We've made plenty of mistakes in the past, and aren't done still, that's what happens when you step out of your comfort zone and into the unknown. 
    & Now that we knew we had to grease it, it was time to find out how. We were going to consult the internet hive-mind, but before we could our neighbour came round to help us out. He lent us the gun, and the little nib, required to pump grease into the prop without taking it apart. Thank you neighbour!
    & Later, we read this: "Props should be greased once a year." 
    & Yiiiiikes- we are terrible at this stuff. The prop seemed fine, we are lucky, and wont fail to do this step in the future.
    & Then, came time to coat the prop and shaft with prop speed, a paint that inhibits growth, in hopes that it wont foul as quickly in the future - something quite necessary, we realized, in NZ waters. 
    & Near the end of our stay in the yard, the 'yard master' was kind enough to let Pino sit in the slings for a day, so we could paint the underside of the keel (the long fin underneath the boat, that gives it righting ability) - at no extra charge! We'd be put back into the water sometime the next day.
    & Unfortunately, then, they dropped us off with our nose pointing inward. We have a hard time driving out backwards, especially in a place like this, surrounded with shallows, with current and lots and lots of wind at our beam. We ended up doing a full 360, coming all too near to the shallows, under the watching eyes of the people at the yard and others on their boats on hardstand. You can be sure that there will always be an audience there watching when you fuck up. 
    & No sailor is beyond making mistakes though, that couple that watched us maneuver clumsily at the yard, also had docking problems coming in. Devine helped them out. No one's perfect - something to remember.
    & Back on our pile mooring in the Town Basin, we finally received our windows and the package of many, many, tubes of {*Fixsil FS200 silicone*} (black gooey stuff). Our windows are not fixed mechanically, all that is holding them in is the black stuff. Some other Yamahas do add bolts, but found that more often than not, these leak, because as I've said, the material twists, expands and contracts. Fixsil FS200 is a high-strength 100% silicone adhesive, it's UV and salt water resistant.
    & An essential part of adding windows without mechanical fixings, is to add spacers, at a size that matches your window's width, height and thickness. The sealant's technical spec sheet should be able to tell you the thickness required, all are different. The spacers we had were little rubbery bits, that we cut to size, and that we glued to the fibreglass with {*contact glue*}. We had planned to fibreglass over them, but decided against it in the end. 
    & The spacers, we placed all around the area where the window would go, so that when we'd apply the sealant, and the window on top, that it would end up resting on the spacers and not push out too much glue while keeping it levelled at even thickness all around. We also added spacers under the window to hold it up, to know exactly where it would go when came time to put it on. Our windows are large and heavy, and the bottom spacers kept breaking off, so we ended up adding SS nails instead.
    & Devine & I then put the windows in place, without sealant, laying against the spacers, to see if it would hold and to mark the areas where we'd have to put tape. The tape ensures the sealant is applied cleanly. I made sure to add enough distance at the top of the window, to ensure the seal would have a good angle. If there is no angle in the seal at the top edge of the window, moisture will accumulate- we don't want that. I also added tape around the windows, from inside the boat as well as a 'bib' under each window, to catch any drippings, if any.
    & We also prepared some bits of wood, that we'd lay outside of the windows to add pressure, a way of making sure that the acrylic stays in place.
    & We had bits of bamboo, and our dinghy oars, with one end covered with foam - as to not damage the window - and the other end would be wedged into the toe rail. The sealant we bought, did say that we would have no need of any mechanical fixings to add pressure, that the sealant would be enough, but we preferred to do it all to ensure a good adhesion.
    & A hard thing about this project, was to wait for the proper weather window to start. The weather needs to be very, very dry, if there's any bit of moisture, it can reduce the adhesive properties of the sealant. This is difficult because it rains a lot in Whangarei, the town lies in a depression, between mountains, making it very rain-prone.
    % blog/nz2.windows.5.jpg
    & Once we did find a day to start, came another problem, the acrylic windows had a thin plastic protective film over them, as i've said before. We removed the outer film, and with it, came the primer- FUCK! The primer was sticking to the film. We called Seamac to ask about this, they said it shouldn't do that, but it did. So we made the best of it. Before putting the windows on, we'd dip our finger in the black stuff and rub it over the parts of the window that had lost bits of primer. From an aesthetic point of view, it would help, although we could see a slight difference in blackness. It's really not a big deal, but when you've planned out every step to perfection, it sucks to have this happen. While no other will notice, this defect is very visible to us.
    % blog/nz2.windows.6.jpg
    & No matter. We pushed on. Jim, our window mentor from the sailboat {*Bright Moments*}, came to help us apply the first window, he'd done this sort of work before and came at our request. His advice turned out to be extremely valuable, we couldn't have done it without him. 
    & We cleaned the surface one last time with isopropyl alcohol, then, came time to open the first tube of sealant. We cut a 'V' shape at the end of the plastic nozzle with a blade, matching the thickness of the spacers, and began to apply it to the fibreglass. Then, we ran over the gooey stuff with a flat tool to spread it well. In hindsight, we should have used a spread tool with little wide teeth, to create gaps, this too would help both sides to stick to each other. I went inside, while Jim and Devine were outside, and put the window in. I had tools at the ready, to 'tool' the sealant around the window, to produce a clean and even finish. I had lots of paper towels around, and trash bags to dispose of them. This was a dirty job, and with the sealant drying quickly, we couldn't waste time cleaning tools or worrying about it staining things in the boat. 
    % blog/nz2.windows.7.jpg
    & Devine and Jim pushed onto the window from outside, pushing it flat against the spacers, with the bottom laying over the nails. It was thusly, perfectly positioned, with the black stuff oozing out of all sides. They then began to tool the area around the windows, removing the excess, and adding more sealant if any was missing anywhere. We kept a little bowl with a mix of water and dishwashing liquid near, you can use a finger to clean up the sealant, dipping it in the bowl of soapy water will stop the gooey black stuff from sticking to it. Inside, I too, was removing the excess, and adding more sealant as needed. Once we'd removed the excess sealant, and that all was clean, and to our liking, we each removed the protective plastic from the acrylic. We couldn't wait too long to do this, because if the sealant dries it'll start coming out in 'strings' and may damage all of our beautiful work. 
    & We removed the film, and then the protective tape, and voila! Window number one was in! We applied mechanical fastenings, pushing the bits of bamboo onto the windows, and then turned to the second, and third window, repeating the same thing. These, we did alone, it's dirty work and Jim helped us enough! THANK YOU JIM :)! 
    % blog/nz2.windows.8.jpg
    & We set plastic tarps back over all windows, to protect them from the weather and the sun, as directed by the sealant's information sheet. We left them covered for a few days. Pino had windows...! We, and the elements, were separate again.
    & We repeated all of it for the port side windows, although, as I mentioned earlier, we made the mistake of using the same templates for both sides of the boat. Don't do that. Boats are very much asymmetrical, we found that out. The windows fit, that wasn't the problem, but the primer around the windows was not perfectly aligned to the fibreglass, which means the plastic film was tough to remove inside at times, and that one of the windows has some primer visible from inside. Not a big deal though, we can scratch that off easily. Not the worse mistake we've made. Still, not all windows are the same, something to remember for the future. 
    & We also realized then, that our front starboard side window, wasn't a real window at all. It's laid onto a full fibreglass backing. How did we miss this? We laughed. They put a window there to make the design of the boat symmetrical, because the port side opened onto the head. If there had been a window on the starboard side, it would have opened onto a dark closet.
    & {*Takeaway*}: People will tell you how you should do things, that's okay, but when everyone starts to do it it can be a bit dizzying, and you might make a wrong decision. If you trust you've done your research, stick with it, you'll do well, just don't skip any steps. Always wait for weather, don't try and finish things too quickly. Ask for help, we asked Jim because we knew he had just redone his windows recently, and because the techniques he used were the same as ours. 
    & Ask questions when and if you can, a lot, about everything, especially in your newbies like us. Mistakes cost money, and when it comes to marine gear, that means a LOT.
    & Also, when doing antifoul, get a good mask. We were running on little money at the time, but should have picked up those masks with the replacement filters. The mask I was wearing keeps some of the dust, but none of the harmful fumes at bay. Also protect your skin, when removing antifoul, I bought a cheap suit which did help.

  HATCH
    % blog/nz2.hatch.0.jpg
    & Now that this project of fear was over, another came to replace it.
    & We wanted to replace our top hatch, which was really just as thick piece of acrylic fastened by SS fittings, and that closed onto a rubber seal. That seal, was beyond done, dried up and crusty by sun and salt. The rubber seal was not protected from the sunlight at all, it's a poor design if you're sailing in warm and sunny places.
    & During our transit to NZ, sea water came in past the crusty seal while I was asleep, a wave splashed over the bow, and slipped inside, sending a torrent of wetness where I was sleeping. The sleeping bag, and the cushions were wet. I remember grabbing a cushion then, and shoving it in the 27x27cm hole and keeping it wedged up there with layers, upon layers of duct tape. This wasn't the best solution. In my defence, I was half asleep, kind of dazed, and grabbed whatever I could find in the dark. It was funny to find the next day though, a cushion thick with salt water and compressed into a tiny space bound by infinite amounts of tape.
    & We thought this top hatch setup wasn't ideal, also the big piece of acrylic had many cracks in it and was near dying. We bought a small {*GEBO hatch*} from {*Seamac*} to replace it with. 
    % blog/nz2.hatch.1.jpg
    & Again, this proved most difficult. The window was too small for the existing hole, so we had to cut a platform out of wood, the outer edge matching the outside part of the hole, we would have to cut a hole in it, sized for the new hatch. We didn't have access to a workshop, and the wood was very, very dense. We used a handsaw to cut it, and it took AGES, many hours of sawing interspersed with bouts of whining and thoughts of dying of old age with this piece of wood, still uncut.
    % blog/nz2.hatch.2.jpg
    & We drilled some holes into the fibreglass, marked holes in the wood and drilled those too, then placed the wooden frame onto the hole, and screwed it into place. Then, we epoxied the shit out of that frame, making it one with the existing body of the boat. We epoxied, waited, sanded, epoxied again, waited, sanded... till it was nice and smooth. 
    % blog/nz2.hatch.3.jpg
    & We painted the entire frame, to a colour approximating that of our boat, except that it had a subtle yellow tint. We also epoxied and painted the area inside the cabin, making for a smooth transition. 
    % blog/nz2.hatch.4.jpg
    & Then, we marked up holes onto our shiny, and yellowy, new base where the window was going to go, and drilled into it. We scuffed the surface lightly, then added some spacers, with contact glue. Once dry, we applied a sealant, grey stuff, that ensures aluminum to fibreglass adhesion. Then, we pressed the window onto it, and put the screws in. We added more sealant around the edges, tooling it in for a clean finish, soapy water at hand, and did the same inside. 
    & Hatch project was done. 
    % blog/nz2.hatch.5.jpg
    & {*Takeaway*}: Maybe, if you can, install the window at a slant, so the water won't collect on it. The surface should be flat and even, but a slant would make it better we feel.
    & {*Hatch*} 300$ <br>{*Total*} 3540$
  TILLER
    & A tiller, for those who don't know, is a steering alternative to a wheel. Instead of a circular wheel, you have a bar, usually made of wood, that is attached to a rudder post, which in turn, is attached to the rudder (a sort of long and thin rectangular flap). If you move the tiller to the left, the rudder moves to the right, and so with this you direct the water one way and then another. Driving with a tiller, gives you a more direct connection to the rudder. Devine & I like to use the fixie analogy, with fixed-wheel bikes you have less components between the pedals and the wheels, it's the same with a tiller and rudder. 
    & A project we were supposed to do while in Mexico, that was then only realized a year later. 
    & The wheel, that we used to steer the boat, is kept there by a big post that is bolted through the deck. Removing the wheel, means you have to remove what is supporting it, and all of the connections leading inside the boat, steering SS cables that lead to a big quadrant (a metal wheel that is attached to the rudder post). A turn of the wheel, pulls on one of the cables, which turns the quadrant and the rudder. 
    & Removing the wheel pedestal, Devine said to me, was easy enough. Devine had to cut through the control cables (when we have the engine running, it's what controls the engine speed), because we couldn't remove some SS screws that had merged with a piece of aluminium (happens, SS and aluminium will corrode over time) - no matter, the control cables had to be replace too anyway. The cockpit now had a large gaping hole in the floor. I went below and removed the wires connected to the quadrant (that big metal wheel attached to the rudder post), cutting away at them with a hacksaw in the dark, in a tiny cramped space. We taped up the underside of the holes, and filled them up from the top with epoxy. Just in time too, because the rain in Whangarei always comes. 
    % blog/nz2.throttle.3.jpg
    & We had a tiller for Pino already, that we'd bought at the same time as the wind vane at a scrapyard in Sonoma CA. The tiller head fit with ours well enough, but ideally, we'd have to make a new one so that the tiller can be made to go lower, currently, it stands quite high, but it doesn't really change much for driving. 
    & Switching from wheel to tiller, meant we had to install both a new throttle lever, and compass. Both of these things were part of the pedestal with the wheel before. 
    & We replaced our old control cables too, which had split and rusted in part, and bought new and longer ones. We routed them to their new place on the port side, in front of the aft locker. Peeking at the place we would have to install the throttle from inside boat, after opening the wall up, we discovered there wasn't enough room to install it there. There wasn't enough height for the cables to bend at a good angle, if the angle is too extreme it can damage them overtime. 
    & We decided then, to install it on the starboard side, access was easier, we could get at it from inside a locker.
    & The two-lever throttle we bought, although very shiny, turned out to be a great big piece of junk. It came with no installation guide, bore no name, no way to find information about it online. We made a hole for it, and installed it, but the lever was super wobbly, we couldn't imagine going to sea with this. 
    & We returned it to {*All Marine*}, saying just this, that it was a giant piece of crap, which they confirmed, and they let us exchange it for another, more expensive, and better model. I guess they knew it was shit? Why keep it in stock then? 
    % blog/nz2.throttle.1.jpg
    & We bought a single-lever throttle, a {Ultraflex B85 side mount(http://discount-marine.co.nz/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=7069)}. The issue now though, was that we'd already made a big hole, and this one needed an even bigger hole. We were able to drill a good hole, a bit offset, that lined with the outer edge of the old one. Doing this wasn't easy, every project requires a different sized hole, and buying a new bit is expensive, and kind of ridiculous - how often will we be making holes this size in our boat? Not too often I hope. We found a used tools shop in Whangarei up Walton street, and were able to borrow a proper sized bit there - yea, borrow, they suggested it. We installed the throttle lever, and its backing, and routed the acceleration cables through Pino's insides and over to the engine room, with much swearing and difficulty.
    % blog/nz2.throttle.2.jpg
    & Pino could go forward again! YAY. I did make a mistake though, of not securing one of the two control cables on the engine well enough, the effect was that as soon as the engine was on, we'd go forward. The cable came off as we were going forward, and stayed stuck in that position. When we set the anchor, we usually rev the engine to go back to make sure its set, if we tried to go backward we'd go forward instead, but didn't notice it the first time, blaming it on the wind or current in the bay where we happened to be.
    & It's not really a big deal, it was windy out, and that alone helped to set our anchor. We fixed it after the second time we tried to anchor, clearly noticing then, that we were moving forward even if the throttle was pointing backward, even in neutral. It was just a matter of reconnecting the cables, and to ensure that the bolts were tight. 
    & We still had more holes to make after this, for our compass, on the port side bulkhead (a dividing wall or barrier between separate compartments inside a ship) on the cabin front. We ordered one online, a small white {Ritchie bulkhead compass(https://www.keoghsmarine.com.au/COMPASSES-Flush-Mount-Compasses-Ritchie-Compasses)}.
    & The bit we had before was too big, we returned it to the used tool places, our boat neighbour had a few, but not exactly the right size. We borrowed one, that was very, very near our desired diameter, and figured we could sand the rest.
    & That turned into a 2-hour long sanding game, sand sand sand, try the compass, nope, sand sand sand. We did fit it eventually, and connected it inside. We realized then that the damned thing didn't come with an LED, we'd looked at so many models, and forgot to make sure it came with it. 
    & During this time, our old pedestal lay on deck, we didn't know what to do with it. We considered selling it, but couldn't be bothered, we had little energy at this point. We decided to bring it to {*Stanley Marine*}, a used boat gear shop. Devine had an idea, and asked if we could exchange the pedestal and wheel, for an old {*15kg Rocna*} we'd seen lying around the back. The owner didn't mind this, so we left Pino's old wheel there, and returned with a heavier anchor! Score!
    & {*Takeaway*}: Don't cheap out on important boat parts, the throttle lever we saw initially looked good at first glance, but was shit. Spending more will not always guarantee quality, but in this case it did. The tiller we bought in Sonoma, is for a boat that has a tiller-post hole that is low on deck, it has a curved shaped, and it sized for a bigger boat than ours - we didn't realize this at the time. It still fits, and works well, but if you change your boat from wheel to tiller, mind the shape of the tiller as well as the tiller-head shape.

  HEADSAIL FURLER
    & We were anchored in Port Maurelle, in Tonga, and needed to get back to Neiafu for supplies. On our way there, we opened our headsail, like usual, but when came time to furl it, I couldn't do it with ease. It was very, very difficult to do. Devine went to the bow to take a look, to see if there wasn't anything jammed in the furler (happens sometimes). 
    - "There's a piece missing!" Devine said
    - "WHAT?! Like, an important one? Well, they're all kind of important aren't they... Which one is it?"
    - "Piece that keeps the long bit with the slides centred, a two-part thing."
    & We always manage to understand each other, even when refer to boat parts as the long bit, and the long long fat bit. 
    & We have an old harken furler, the piece we lost was one of two pieces keeping the slides for the jib centred in the drum - we lost an upper part of the drum. The backing piece was still there at least, we didn't have too many options, and put a hose clamp, and shoved bits between it and the slides to keep it centred, before covering it all with duct tape. A temporary fix, that brought us safely into New Zealand.
    & I didn't know if it was going to be possible to find that exact piece we'd lost, we didn't look, and anyways, we didn't want to spend an outrageous amount of money on a harken service kit. What we did do, was draw up a new piece for it on paper, took measurements, and had a piece made by a machinist in town. It was inexpensive, quick, and it fits perfectly. 
    & {*Take away*}: Look at every part that is screwed in on your boat, as often as you can, so you don't lose them like we did. I check items on the mast often, but didn't think of looking at the furler. Service kits are expensive, try and DIY it if you can, if you can something just as clean and just as strong especially.

  RIGGING
    % blog/nz2.rigging.1.jpg
    & Again, while in Tonga, our friend Alex came over to talk to us, and standing in his dinghy from the water, noticed a cut in our port side {intermediate shroud(https://www.sailboat-cruising.com/sailboat-rigging.html)}. An intermediate shroud, is one of many wires that are holding up the mast. This one, leads above the second spreader (a spar, that deflects the shrouds) on the side of the mast. Our boat has two sets of spreaders, because we have a very tall mast - not everyone has intermediate shrouds. The cut was just near the lock (the part that squeezes, and connects the wire to the turnbuckle), a single cut in one of the strands. This was bad news. We had it fixed, temporarily, cutting the wire and adding a second turnbuckle - with Herbert's help (thank you sensei). We needed to fix this, and while in Whangarei, thought we'd replace the port side intermediate and the backstay (a wire from the mast that leads to the back of the boat) as well. We had an insulated backstay, the electrical isolation of a section of wire, but no SSB (single side band radio)onboard, and no intention of having one, so we replaced the whole thing. We were told that this could be a potential breaking point too, this made us more sure of this decision.
    & We removed our intermediate shrouds, securing the mast with halyards (lines used to hoist sails up) on both sides, our mast is keel-stepped though, mean that it goes through the deck and goes inside the cabin. We coiled the wires up, and carried them to {*C-spar*} at Dockland 5 by bike. 
    % blog/nz2.rigging.4.jpg
    & Daniel, a rigger and friend, was kind enough to deliver the new wires, since he was in the area. We found out later that Daniel was husband to {*Laura Dekker*}, funny, since {*S/V Guppy*} sat diagonally to us on the pile moorings. 
    % blog/nz2.rigging.2.jpg
    & The issue with replacing the intermediate shrouds though, was that the T-terminals they had were too big to fit in the backing plates of our mast. A t-terminal is a piece at the top of end of the wire, shaped like a T (as the name suggests), that fits into a backing plate that is attached in your mast with rivets (a permanent mechanical fastener). The backing plate is in a hole, in your mast, and has a little elongated slot for the T to fit into, it fits at an angle and when turned the little arms of the T keep it in place.
    & Daniel came over to take a look, and ended up drilling the rivets out of the starboard side backing plate to get it out, so they could see how to fit the terminals into them back in the shop. The T-terminals were shaved down slightly, and the hole in the backing plate made bigger, with much care, using a drill and bit.
    % blog/nz2.rigging.5.jpg
    & The backing plate was installed again, but it took some time before we could do that. We needed an air compressor, to use a gun to get them back on there. As it turns out, our rivets are big, and doing it by hand near impossible - on a pile mooring, there was no way to power that compressor. We waited till our haul out to do it, since C-spar was at that yard, and that they could bring the compressor there to do it. This is what happened. Daniel climbed up the mast while the boat was on hardstand, this wasn't our idea, but then again, the cradles were made strong, better than how they do it in BC. It seemed safe enough, there was little chance that the boat would tip over. It's always better to go up the mast while in the water, since the boat has righting ability, and won't risk tipping. 
    & Once the backing plate was back in, I hauled Devine up the mast (when back in the Town basin), and he widened the backing plate, same as the other one. This was tricky, because our drill has a cord. We connected the drill to a long extension, and then to the generator on deck. We were able to replace both intermediate shrouds then. We had to do this quick, cause Devine had trouble holding the weight of the drill, and the whole length of the extension aloft. 
    & The backstay was easier to do, but was heavier to carry by bike. The new wire would be lighter, without the insulated part. Our other wires, we deemed good enough. No cuts. We'd wait until our return to BC to replace them, that, with the running rigging.
    & {*Takeaway*}: Re-doing your rigging at a dock is much easier, much, much easier. Having access to shore power would have been handy. I bought norseman cones online from rig-rite, had them shipped from the US for way too much money. Avoid rig-rite if you can, their service is shit and they'll charge you a ridiculously high amount to ship the part without warning you of it. Glad i bought more cones than we needed though, when comes time to replace the other cables we'll have them on hand already.

  MAINSAIL
    % blog/nz2.sail.1.jpg
    & Our first idea for the main, was to get the material, and to try and sow it up ourselves. We'd heard of people doing this before, sailrite sells a lot of kits to do it. We didn't want to order from the US, and thought we'd go to a local sail loft to ask if they could make the cuts for us.
    & We believed we could do it, and even asked for the advice of {*UK sails*}. They were glad of our interest in this, and even gave us a stack of old needles to try in our sewing machine, as well as a slab of thick sail to do tests on. Unfortunately, our thrift store machine did not prove worthy of the task. But also, this, along with all the work we'd already done, was just too much. We had much ambition, but little time and energy. 
    & Sails can last a long, long time, so we put in the money to get it done right in the end.
    & We tend to get carried away in our ideas, while I would like to sow up my own sail someday, now wasn't the time to experiment. We needed something solid, something that could get us through the hard sailing we'd have to do the next year.
    % blog/nz2.sail.2.jpg 
    & We carried our old main over to UK sails, and chatted about what we wanted for our new main. We opted for a loose-footed sail (a sail that doesn't run in a track on the boom, only attached by two points), full-batten (made with pockets for long battens, that help keep the shape of the sail), 3 reefs (reinforced points of attachment, that you put lines through, and that you use to keep the sail down and tied when making the sail smaller in big winds), thick, with a black circle stuck to both sides. We don't have a staysail, a thick and small storm sail that is used instead of the mainsail in big weather, so we thought that this thicker main, with a third reef, could act as that. The people at UK sails were so damn nice to us, answering all our questions, and letting us film the process. We also had our jib (our headsail) re-stitched, we couldn't really afford to get this one replaced entirely, but it's still good and strong.
    % blog/nz2.sail.3.jpg
    & {*Take away*}: DIY is great if you have time. Sailmaking is intricate work, hard to get right, especially in a small cramped space. I think we could have succeeded, but again, this wasn't the time for experimenting. Pino needs a good set of wings, it is our main means of propulsion after all. If you are interested in doing it yourself though, there are plenty of tutorials around, and ask your local sail loft for advice, if they love their work and see you have an interest in it, they'll offer help.

  AIS
    % blog/nz2.ais.1.jpg
    & If we hope to get to Japan safely, we need AIS. "AIS stands for "automatic identification system", it's an automatic tracking system used on ships and by vessel traffic services. AIS information supplements marine radar, which continues to be the primary method of collision avoidance for water transport (definition sourced from wikipedia)." 
    & There is a lot of traffic in Japanese waters, making it necessary to be seen by other means. We have radar, but it uses more power than AIS to function, with radar we can know that something is out there, but we don't know the boat's name, size or heading. AIS provides all of this information, with it, you can call a boat by name on the radio if need be, and they, can see you and call you as well if you have a transponder (a device that transmits your boat's information).
    & Our first idea, was to DIY this (this is a common theme in this post isn't it?) with a {Raspberri Pi Daisy hat(https://www.tindie.com/products/astuder/daisy-hat-ais-receiver-for-raspberry-pi/)}. 
    % blog/nz2.ais.3.jpg
    & This Raspberry Pi project turned out to be too big of a leap. We had little Pi experience then. We also needed more then the dAISy hat could offer, more reliability, and range. We also wanted to transmit our position, and it's why in the end we opted for a {Vesper XB-8000 transponder(https://www2.vespermarine.com/xb8000-ais-transponder)}.
    & I never thought we'd buy this, already then, I was scared of all the big spendings we'd been doing, but we figured it was well worth the price. The unit itself is costly, but made worse by the fact that you need to buy a splitter to connect it to the VHF antenna. A splitter removes the need for a separate VHF antenna for an AIS receiver or transponder and allows a single antenna to be shared with a VHF radio. The antenna splitter also provides signal gain, improving AIS reception and range. The unit we got, has a low-noise amplifier, it helps to get a good signal on smaller lower power devices that are transmitting out there. 
    & We walked out of there, wide-eyed, half-regretting. We both took on some extra work to help us cover these costs, because ouch.
    & Installing it wasn't too tough. We routed the wires from the back rail of the boat, inside the radar post, through the cockpit locker, under the flooring, through the ceiling, and down over to the port side breaker panels. Easy? Not really. Pino has a lot of extra wiring, that leads to nothing, junk that was left hanging in the boat by previous owners and that we haven't bothered to remove because of how shitty a job it is. There's still old GPS, SSB, modem wires running through here. We set up the antenna outside, on the rail, and the unit inside the breaker panel, stuck to the back wall with the splitter. Connecting it, and setting it up, was simple - how rare. 
    % blog/nz2.ais.2.jpg
    & After installing it, and spending some time at sea with it, we were happy to have it. One night we had forty knots at our backs, there were big seas, a ship lay in front of us, too close. My eyes couldn't see them in the night. We were running downwind and could not manoeuvre so well, and the other ship was a power boat, going real slow. We were surfing at 8 knots, we'd catch up in no time. I saw them on AIS, saw their name, gave them a call to warn them of our passing, we weren't going to run into them, but we'd pass awful close. They told us they were running under headsail, and that they too could not manoeuvre too well, but were happy to know we knew they were there. 
    & That peace of mind, of them knowing we're there, and being clear on our intentions, made it worth it. 
    & {*Take away*}: We will always opt for the DIY option first, even it a lot of times it we fail at it. We are still, happy to try though. The DAISy hat may be a good option for a lot of people, we still have it aboard, and will continue to play with it. 
    & {*AIS*} 1200$ <br>{*Splitter*} 400$ <br>{*Grand total of*} 9490$ 
    & Wow. This doesn't include materials, like epoxy, paintbrushes, sealants, nails, screws, etc that we had to get to complete these projects. 
    & That about sums up what we got done while in New Zealand, and it's the reason why we didn't travel much with the boat. There are many more things we wanted to change aboard, like changing our head to a composting head, changing to a manual windlass, removing a lot of old wiring and things we no longer use like our water heater etc. Removing the head, would mean making additional room for water, that would have been good for this trip but again, we had to prioritize.
    & We made a lot of mistakes, and foolishly thought we could all do it ourselves. While I prefer to do that most times, it's not always possible. We had too much on our shoulders already, we didn't need the stress. We did do a lot of it on our own, and even the things we had help with, we took part in in some way. Learning to do it all yourself is important, but we are no experts, we'll continue to learn and when we've got more time and room to experiment we'll try and do these things on our own. It's important to ask for help though, there is a lot of value in having a mentor around, not something that is common these days. Our mentors, are all the sailors we meet, and that take time, sitting with us, answering our questions, or ever coming to help us in the task we need to do.
    & I'll close this post, by thanking all in NZ who helped us out, for repairs, general advice - whatever. Time  and knowledge is precious, we thank you: {*Herbert & Asma*} (s/y Maya), {*Jim & Linda*} (S/Y Bright moments), {*Pauline and Antoine*} (s/y Magellan), {*Becky Jeffries*} (uksails) & {*Daniel*} (c-spar).

AN ISLAND TO ONESELF
  SETTINGS
    Location : Whangarei, New Zealand
    Date : 2018-06-01
  Lazy times in New Zealand
    % blog/nz9.jpg
    & Traveling to {*New Zealand*}, after a year of unknown, was a great comfort to us. There are a few things Devine and I were really looking forward to, like a good latte, craft beer, a fresh food market and a bulk food store. I found a city that checked all of the boxes. 
    & Many of the cruisers we know want to arrive in {*Opua*} – with reason. It's warm, damn gorgeous, and you know you'll find friends there because that's where everyone goes during typhoon season. Arriving in a strange place with familiar faces always makes the experience better, but knowing this, we still chose {*Whangarei*}. 
    & I first pronounced Whangarei as 'one-gah-rey', but the proper way to say it is 'fah-ngah-rey'. A friend corrected me early on, thus sparing me the embarrassment of mispronouncing it aloud in public – I embarrass myself plenty enough as it is. I know that no one would think me a fool for making a mistake like this, but I do like learning the correct way to say things.
    & Why did we choose to go there? Because staying in the Whangarei Town Basin is inexpensive, convenient, with everything just a short walk away. We'd also read that it was a good place for boat projects, and since Pino needed a lot of attention, this too, we thought, tipped the scale in its favour. We also noted that it was close to {*Auckland*}. Well, it looked closer on a map. We became very familiar with that stretch of land, and of the actual distance between the two places, during the 8 months we spent there.
    & The first thing we did upon arriving, was to replenish our store of dried goods at Bin Inn, a really great bulk food store. The second thing, was purchasing a home brew kit - priorities amirite?  And the third thing, was to get a latte. 
    & I'll never forget the look on Devine's face after taking a sip of that cup of freshly brewed beans, a delicious pool of dark liquid topped with a pillowy cloud of soy milk.
    & Joy incarnate.
    % blog/nz1.jpg 
  Stocking up
    & We hadn't had soy milk since Mexico, and our store of good coffee beans didn't last. Most of the year we spent drinking instant. We're not dependent on soy milk, we can do without it, but having a fancy drink with it every now and then is a hell of a treat. We became loyal customers of {Fat Camel(http://grimgrains.com/#coffee)}, the best cafe in town, which also happens to make the best falafel pitas. 
    & Our dry goods pantry was replenished. We had buckwheat, black rice, cornmeal, lentils and chickpeas again! When in Tonga, we'd gone through most of our staples, everything we had stocked-up with since leaving Mexico. We were down to canned chickpeas, quick oats and white rice. Living on land, our diet always had a great diversity to it, and we like to keep it that way but it's not always possible to do this. We're learning how to stock-up better, as to never be in this position again.
    & Our first month in New Zealand was cold. We spent most of our time indoors, wiping condensation from our windows, watching newly hatched ducklings eating algae off our hull, and working to help our bank accounts recover. We had many expensive projects to do on Pino before setting back out again, like changing our windows, getting AIS, a new mainsail, plumbing, extra solar panels, new batteries... and the list went on, and on. We continued work on our AI tactics game {Markl(http://markl.100r.co)}, while taking contracts with former clients. Devine also spent much time improving {**} and {*Dotgrid*} during that time too.
  Sailing to Pakatoa
    & In late December, we took a break from work and sailed out to {*Pakatoa*}, a small island in the Hauraki gulf. We were going to meet-up with people from {Hackland(http://hackland.nz)}, a maker space, that we'd met on a trip to Auckland a few weeks prior. Others were going to meet us there too, game devs, musicians, peer-to-peer developers... sure enough, all of them had sailboats. New Zealand is bordered by water and near the roaring forties, not surprising to have so many here with boats. The sailing culture is strong in Aotearoa.
    & We sailed down from Whangarei, making a stop for the night in {*Urquharts Bay*}. A dinghy came over, a couple came to say hello because they recognized our boat.
    % blog/nz10.jpg
    - "We used to have a Yamaha 36!"
    & They said to us, very much excited to see our boat here in the bay.
    - "We've been here in new zealand for a long while, and have sold the boat some time ago. Good boats they are Yamahas!"
    & That's something we hear a lot. That Yamahas are strongly-built boats. It brought us here, to New Zealand from Canada so it must be good! Their current boat was an aluminium yacht, beautiful unpainted grey hull. That's a dream we have, Devine & I, to have a yatch like that for high latitude sailing. 
    & A dream for later times. 
    % blog/nz4.jpg
    & Early the next morning, Pino spread its wings and we sailed down to {*Kawau Island*}. All the bays there were cluttered with moorings, but Pino's not a big boat and were able to secure a place in North cove. Unlike the Whangarei Town basin, the water here was blue, not clear, but wonderful shades of turquoise. I learned later that this is where my heroine {Lin Pardey(resources)} lives.
    & Next, we sailed to Pakatoa. We found a place to anchor there, Dom was already there on his boat, and kayaked over to say hello. Soon, the rest of the flotilla arrived, Rocinante, with Tece and Emre, Festina Lente, with Helena and Joran, and then came Elliot and Neftaly. Robin and Courtenay aboard spaceship Tangaroa could not join us, but we kept them in memory. The Ephemeral yatch club was not whole. Pino was, in that moment, the biggest fish in the fleet at 10m. 
    & Crazy, we thought, there's a first time for everything.
  A private island tour
    & We soon went ashore for a guided tour of the island. Pakatoa is a private island, and bird sanctuary, you can go ashore, provided you have the permission of the caretaker Nigel. We got to go, because our friend knew him. The place was full of abandonned bungalows, and free-roaming wekas - a flightess bird, endemic to New Zealand. 
    & The name Rekka is awful close to weka. Found myself thinking in Elmer Fudd's voice for the rest of the day. 
    - "Wekas eve-wee-wey! Kill the wa-bbit, kill the wa-bbit!". 
    & Pakatoa used to be a resort in the 60's, and was abandonned and left as is. We had a walk inside the bungalows, there are 60 of them on the island, all were standing, some looking better than others. We couldn't help but think of what we could do with this island if we owned it, we could build an off-grid community of artists! 
    % blog/nz18.jpg
    & Walking around the yard, we saw giants balls of metal, heavy moorings maybe, although they resembled explosive mines. Then, came the graveyard of disused items, old furniture, kitchen ware... a pile of old stoves sat on one side.
    - "Look at those!" Devine said.
    & Dom began to list the merits of the Countess stoves, like a proper salesman, to the merriment of Devine who listened, laughing.
    % blog/nz16.jpg
    & Nigel brought us to a collection of tall silos, claiming that up there, we could have the best view of the island. He set a ladder up to one of the silos, and one by one we climbed up onto it. It stood high off the ground, while scary - for me at least - it did prove to be a worthwhile climb. The view was amazing. From here, we could see our boats in the anchorage below, with moving crescents in the water created by the oncoming gusts of wind. 
    - "Might want to tuck your boat in closer inland" the caretaker told us.
    & We could see from here that we had anchored Pino a bit further out than everyone else, things look closer than they appear when you're down there. 
    - "Wind's rising."
  On buying an island
    & Then, we began talking about the logistics of buying an island such as this, or how it would be to manage a community of people living here. It was all too easy to imagine - it could work, couldn't it? 
    % blog/nz11.jpg
    & Some of the old bungalows could be repurposed, the materials were still good. Getting goods on and off the island would be a challenge, a boat would be necessary, but we had that part covered. The hardest thing to do in a new, and large community of people, is to agree on rules, on a code of conduct. This is something we really did like to think about, wondering then if anyone like us had ever attempted to make an offer on the island. It was clear that the owner wasn't keen on selling it especially, Nigel mentioned there being no shortage of offers from wealthy buyers. We imagined then, speaking to the owner...
    - "Hey, we don't have any money to buy the island, but could we just, y'know, have it?"
    & Bet no one's asked him that before. Ballsy much? 
    - "So you want my million dollar island, for free?"
    - "Yep! Exactly that. Thank you."
    & With images of an island of our own, we each climbed back down from the silo, imaginations aflutter. 
    & We strolled into the main resort complex next. The first building, was the game room. Devine and Elliot played Ping Pong, and squash in the old court, the sound of their playing resonating throughout.

    & Devine looked at an old desk, covered with a thick film of dust and made a print of a hand on it, then traced the word 'witch' on top of it with a finger, a-la-silent hill. Any moment now, the sirens would blare, the sky would darken with the paint coming off the walls to reveal their caged innards, and pyramid head would come strolling in, death in his heart. 
    - "Maybe he'd like ping pong." 
    & I thought then.
    & This place had an eerie quality to it. The room keys were all set on their hooks, never to be used again. A computer room, with old computers and discs, amassed cobwebs, close to that a bar, bottles of spirits intact, undrunk. There was also a stack of old Pakatoa money, the island's own currency. The pool was empty and thirsty, ghosts of tourists walking about and taking turns on the dive board. 
    % blog/nz13.jpg
    & What an amazing island. Once alive, now dormant, locked in time for the unforeseeable future. 
  BBQ on the beach
    & We spent the evening on the beach, making a fire and roasting vegetables on a hot place that we set atop of it. The caretaker sat with us.
    - "First time I've ever seen people roasting JUST vegetables on this plate." he said.
    & I smiled at this. We had a wild assortment of capsicum, kumara, onions... no meat or fish to be seen. This, was the best ever bbq.
    & I watched sand bugs, leap all too near to the flames before popping out of existence. The fire was the only source of light, aside from the stars, which we could see clearly from where we stood. 
    & We heard excited laughs on the beach.
    - "This...this is amazing!" 
    & We'd hear.
    - "YOU GUYS! You HAVE to come and see this!" 
    & Someone realized that the sand on the beach had bioluminescence. We'd experienced this many times in the past, in water, when splashing around in it, but never in sand. It's a phenomenon I've also observed while flushing the head, waste swirling downward into a flurry of bright green sparks - toilet magic. All of us began to walk in the dark, watching as every step expanded outward with a green glow. It was unreal. An amazing spectral display, like an interactive installation, the ground drawing up colour and light with every contact. By then, Joran, Elliot and Helena had gone for a swim, they laughed and splashed around, their movements clear to us in the dark because of the green glow.
    % blog/nz12.jpg
    & The next day, we awoke early and had coffee with Nigel. I brought fresh pitas I'd made, and had them with the gift of pekmez (mix of tahini and fruit molasses) from Tece and Emre. What a great place to wake up to, I thought then, as I sat on the porch, warm cup in hand. 
    & Before we left, many thanks were said to the caretaker, for allowing us to see this wonderful place. Don't think I've seen anything quite like it. 
    % blog/nz2.jpg
  A race to Waiheke
    & We set sail to {*Waiheke*} next, making a race of it, well, it wasn't a race until Dom raised his spinnaker. The black sail billowed ahead of his boat, and gave him great speed, we decided to do the same. Our gennaker was hoisted, freed, its wrinkles smoothed out for the first time in a long while. Pakatoa disappeared in the distance. 
    - "We'll be back," I said, "we'll make a home of you yet!"
  Whangarei, our second home
    & We returned to Whangarei, just in time for the beginning of the good weather. That summer, we had highs of 30, and through a hole in the ozone, the unobstructed new zealand sun burned our skin if exposed without protection. Whangarei resembled the city of Sidney on Vancouver Island, small, but with everything near, just a short walk away. Also conveniently near, was a complex network of forest walks. We could walk 10 minutes and arrive in {*Mair park*}, and another 30 minutes would take us to a waterfall, and tall Kauri trees. 
    & We walked in silence, listening to the song of the Tuis, clicks, cackles, timber-like creaks, and other sounds unheard by human ears, beyond our register. 
    & Another walk we much enjoyed, was 'the loop', going through town, over to the bascule bridge and across it. The walk would take an hour to do, would take us right back to the Town Basin and was pleasant. At low-tide, we saw the long-legged birds with their thin beaks, poking into the mud for food. At high-tide, came eels undulating in the water, and cormorants swimming just under the surface in groups. Past the bascule bridge, was an field, empty, if it weren't for the local {Pukekos(http://kokorobot.ca/#animals)}. Their blue bodies stood clear against the dry yellow, and greenish grasses, as did their bright orange beaks. These, along with the {Kāruhiruhi(http://kokorobot.ca/#animals)} were our favourites. 
    % blog/nz6.jpg
    & I didn't care much for birds before we started sailing, but now I look for them wherever I go. New zealand is the best place for one who likes birds. Before humans came and messed it all up, this land was kingdom to birds. I like to imagine what the world was like then, when the giant Moas walked the earth, hunted by an even bigger winged being, the Haast eagles. 
    & Much of the places we've been in New Zealand, have left a lasting impression on us. From the sulphuric mud pools of {*Rotorua*}, to Tauranga's towering, {*mount Maunganui*}. The {*Te papa museum*} in {*Wellington*}, and the {giant soldiers of Gallipoli(https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/visit/exhibitions/gallipoli-scale-our-war)}, left a lasting lump in my throat. 
    % blog/nz7.jpg
    & The walks in and around {*Tutukaka*} we aren't close to forgetting. Long beaches, leading to tall mounts, whose summits reveal exquisite, and unique views of the world. Paths that can only be crossed at low-tide, made dangerous by the passage of water. 
    & Nature is strong here, and the paths are wild enough that you forget at times that there is a city just a short distance away. 
    & It would be very easy to make a home here, we thought, it's similar to Canada in many ways. The problem is we're not quite ready to settle anywhere just yet, but like many of the places we've been this becomes another option for us, another place to be. New Zealand is a strong candidate. 
    & We loved our time there, and the people we've met that made us feel all too welcome. 
    % blog/nz19.jpg
    & We will be back, perhaps aboard an alu-hulled yacht, maybe with a plan to get an island for zero cash. We have plenty of plans for the future, that is one thing we're never short on.

CAPTAIN, WHAT IS THIS?

    Location : Savusavu, Fiji
    Date : 2018-06-12
  Checking into Savusavu in Fiji
    % blog/savusavu3.jpg
    & After 15 days on the water, you can imagine how eager we were to get into port. It was the 27th of June, we left on the 12th from Opua. We hove-to for the night, waiting for sunrise before entering {Savusavu bay(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savusavu)}. After repeated mistakes, we learned that entering a strange harbour in the dark is most unwise. There is no point in arriving early, considering yachts cannot anchor in Fiji waters before checking in, and check-in is only possible after 8am.
    & At dawn, we pointed towards Vanua Levu and started sailing again, the wind at our backs. I went below to make some coffee, both of us needed a boost. Devine was in the cockpit, keeping a wary eye on a large storm cloud ahead. The wind increased as we neared it, but it did not trouble us long. We made our way inside the reef, which offered some protection from the building swells. Now closer to land, we could see rows of hills ahead, and caught the perfume of greenery with it. After that, came a sure sign of civilization: buildings, low, with green and red roofs. As we got nearer, came an even more obvious marker of civilization: cars, and small power boats. We'd arrived.  
    % blog/savusavu4.jpg
    & We neared the entrance to Nakama creek around 9am, and radio'ed the authorities on channel 16. 
    - "Savusavu port authority, Savusavu port authority, this is sailing vessel Pino, over." 
    & This, I repeated 3 times, no answer. We slowed down, awaiting a reply. The commercial wharf lay ahead, we could see boats on moorings, some abandonned, others belonging to people we'd seen or met accross the pacific. 
    - "Sailing vessel Pino, this is Coprashed marina. There is no port authority in Savusavu, how can I help you today?" 
    - "We're looking to check in," I said. 
    - "Where did you sail from?" 
    - "Opua, New Zealand." 
    - "Did you send your advance arrival notice?" 
    - "I did send it yes, and received confirmation for it too." 
    & We'd heard they were all too severe about the advance arrival notice, which was about 10 pages too long. I'd sent it to the proper people by email, although half of the messages bounced back and other cruisers reported the same thing happening. With the document being so large, it's no wonder their inboxes are always full. I even tried again while underway, no luck. No matter, I'd received a reply from the custom office, at least one of the messages made it.
    - "Continue into the harbour, past the wharf, and over to our building which stands on your starboard side. It is a white building. Once you arrive closer hail us again." 
    & We moved deeper into the creek, looking for a white building on the shore. Once we were past the wharf I called them again, they mentioned a dock and instructed us to tie to it. I didn't expect to have to dock the boat, from what we'd read online we didn't have to do that! Things do change from year to year, and from boat to boat. The fenders weren't ready, and neither were the docking lines. I ran around the boat, gathering everything, all the while trying to figure out where that damned dock was. We spotted one ahead then, with a ramp, but with no building near it.
    - "Do you think that's it?"
    - "I don't know – looks shallow, plus there's people with dive suits on it. It's probably for the locals." 
    & We glimpsed another free dock further ahead, a finger, part of the marina, it looked like a regular slip. Getting there meant moving inbetween a few boats, channel markers and moorings – the floating dock seemed a better option in comparison. Then, we saw two persons on the marina finger, waving us over. This is where we'd have to dock. Docking is always a nerve-wrecking experience, we didn't have current to contend with but perpendicular to the dock, was a large power boat, with nothing between it and our bow. If we came in too fast, we'd bump into it for sure – bumping into still objects is always embarassing. I was still attaching fenders at this point, while Devine manoeuvered Pino around various obstacles.  
    % blog/savusavu6.jpg
    - "Sailing vessel Pino, this is Coprashed marina."
    & They couldn't have picked a worse time to hail us, the dock lay ahead and two of the lines weren't yet set up. I ran inside, sweating from all the running, it was also 26C out, and I was in full foul-weather gear. Couldn't they see that we were right there and that they could ask us questions later?
    - "This is Pino." 
    & I said to them on the radio, trying to peel part of my foul weather gear off because I was cooking inside it.
    - "Where was your last port again?" 
    - "Opua, New Zealand," I said.
    & I shut off the VHF off, determined to not answer if they asked anything else. I darted back outside. We were right near the quarantine dock, I set up the last two dock lines, and threw the ends to the marina staff. We slowed to a stop, our bow drawing all too near to the boat ahead. I noticed then, the name on its side, a New Zealand boat, we'd seen them power past us on AIS on the way up here. 
    & All went well in the end, Pino was at the dock and we could relax. The marina staff were friendly, one of the line handlers shook our hand.
    - "Bula! Bula! Welcome to Savusavu!"
    - "Bula!" we repeated.
    & We wished we'd bothered to learn some Fijian before arriving here. Bula could mean welcome, or hello, we hoped for the latter, us repeating "Welcome!" would be awkward indeed. We waited for the proper authorities to visit, and noticed then that the new zealand power boat had bands of yellow with 'crime scene' written all over it. 
    - "Is that what happens when they find undeclared veggies aboard?" 
    & We wondered, all the while becoming paranoid about the bit of ginger and pumpkin we'd hidden away. We saw police walking the docks, everyone we'd met so far was all smiles, but these guys looked serious. They wandered off for a second, I stepped off Pino, moving a short distance away, to try and take a photo of Devine and the boat to show others we'd arrived. I took a photo, but a second after, Devine motioned for me to return, a marina attendant was walking towards us as if to say that we had to stay on the boat. With the stone-faced police walking about, it was best to heed their warning. 
    % blog/savusavu.jpg
    & It was some time before the authorities came to see us. The first, in the long line of officials, was the health inspector. He was a friendly fellow, dressed in casual wear, a colorful blouse and sandals. He had us sign and fill papers – writing down Pino's info and our passport numbers is second nature now. 
    - "Is it just you two? Did anyone die aboard this vessel?"
    - "Uh, yes and no."
    & Important not to get those mixed up.
    - "Any animals? Insects?"
    - "Do sea birds count?" 
    & I did not say this aloud, but at sea, the thought of having a gannet friend always crossed my mind. 
    - "No animals, no." 
    & Saying this, my mind screamed 'gannet friend' over and over again. 
    - The officer nodded. "Are you sick?"
    - "No."
    - "Are you sure?"
    - "No. I mean, yes! Sure! So sure. We're so healthy."
    & I could see him writing this down now, Rekka and Devine: "so healthy". He then began to talk to us about the mosquitoe situation. While Fiji doesn't have it as bad as other places, there have been instances of dengue. Ah, dengue, we'd first heard of it while in Japan, there was an outbreak and no one could visit the parks. I didn't know what it was back then, just that it's something you didn't want to get. Since then, we came to be very familiar with dengue, Devine contracted it in Nuku Hiva. You can say we weren't keen on a repeat, dengue is no joke. The health officer wanted to make sure we understood that.
    - "Fiji doesn't want you sick." Fair enough.
    & Then, we had a visit from the quarantine officer, an indian-fijian, who was very excited to hear that we didn't consume dairy or animals. He admitted to consumming some meat, and aspired to lessen it to none. We had a long conversation about this, and even showed him a book we had on cooking in India. We spoke about the consumption of meat, and he mentioned a lot of the health risks associated with it. Like in the west, people in Fiji too suffered because of it. I'd almost finished filling out papers, when two fijian women arrived with more. They were the customs and bio security officials. They asked to come inside. The boat was a mess, I went in and shoved everything we had in the v-berth to make room in the saloon. I also set up the table, since it appeared as though we had many more documents to fill – yay. The two women gave us the first wave of sheets to read and sign, and began to look through our lockers, asking us questions about our stores. One of them took our passports, and began to look through every page, matching the exit stamps with what we'd written on our advance arrival notice.
    - "You came from Opua." 
    - "Yes." 
    - "Before this?" 
    - "Tonga." 
    - "Before this?" 
    - "Niue, cook islands, french polynesia, mexico, USA and then Canada."
    & She looked for the stamps in our passports. 
    - "Where is the mexico stamp?" 
    & Mexico and US don't stamp Canadian passports on entry and exit, it's how it is, but it was hard to make her understand this. The other woman was opening every locker, pulling out bags and asking us questions about their contents. 
    - "Captain, what is this?" 
    - "Lots and lots of coffee." 
    - "Beans?" 
    - "Yes, it's better kept as beans." 
    & Then the quarantine officer pushed another paper for us to sign, all while making a mess of our galley (our boat kitchen) and asking questions about where we'd been. It was a dizzying experience, having so many people aboard, with the table covered in pieces of writing: 'sign this, sign that!' This moment, was made even more chaotic, with them exchanging pleasantries (we hope) in Fijian. Devine and I smiled at one another, what a strange scene, sometimes they didn't even pay attention to us at all.
    - "So, you left from Mexico when?" one of the women asked.
    & She was inspecting every inch of our passports and had noticed how the numbers on our passports followed each other, and decided that this was suspicious. It is odd, but it's what happens when you have new passports processed together. 
    - "Captain." 
    & The other woman began, she was on her hands and knees, head under the sink. She pulled away, holding the end of a hose with a bottle of mexican dry salsa wedged into it. 
    - "What is this?" 
    & In Rarotonga, we disconnected the water pressure hoses since we no longer had a pressure faucet. We didn't have any plugs around the boat to close them up, but what we did have, were many sample-sized bottles of mexican dry salsa, or Tajín. The bottle end was a perfect fit, and we'd since forgotten to replace them with something else. 
    & Devine and I looked at each other, supressing a laugh, we never thought we'd ever have to justify this crappy fix to anyone. Now we had 3 Fijian officials onboard, all looking at the bottle of salsa en polvo, waiting for an explanation. 
    - "It's dry salsa, from Mexico."
    & They said nothing, and didn't ask any more about it, which was good considering there was little more we did want to say. I'm sure they've stumbled upon worse things, or it's possible that all foreign yachts stuff salsa bottles, or other oddities up their hoses. 
    & We thought they'd only be looking through the galley cupboards and lockers, but they decided they needed to look through everything, and I do mean everything. I remembered then the pumpkin and ginger root we'd hidden, one lay under clothes in a bin, the other stuffed deep inside our dirty laundry bag. We hadn't mentioned we had these left-over, because we wanted to eat them – I care deeply about my rhizomes and squashes. I became paranoid, would they fine us for not declaring them? I could see it now, one of the women pulling a large pumpkin out of our laundry bag, eyes on us and asking, "Captain, what is this?".
    & They looked in our bilge, under the settee cushions, and in all the bags stacked up in the quarter berth too. All the while, getting nearer to the v-berth, where I had my illegal vegetables. They looked in the head, and at the plastic bags of medicines we'd inherited from Asma and Herbert from Maya. They didn't care about most of the medicines we had, but the woman did find a stack of sealed needles. 
    - "Captain, what is this?" 
    - "They're needles." 
    - "Why so many?" 
    & I wished I could remember why Maya had this many so I could repeat and sound like I knew what I was talking about. I didn't know what to say, but no matter, the woman found some other item of interest: our tattoo needles. 
    - "It's for tattoos." 
    & Then we showed them a plastic box with our tattoo machine and gear. 
    - "Do you like tattoos?" Devine asked.
    & The woman looked at Devine's neck, and at my arm. 
    - "No" she said, unimpressed. 
    & The other official began telling me if I knew how to remove tattoos, as if to make sure I knew there were options in case I did change my mind about having them. This was a big contrast to the people in French Polynesia, who gave us a thumbs up as we walked past. 
    & The officials spent a lot of time on Pino, they were a pleasant bunch but at this point in the day we were running on fumes. We'd slept 3 hours that night, this, plus the accumulated exhaustion from 15 days of sailing. They did leave eventually, and didn't bother checking out the v-berth. By then, we'd decided they cared little about our secret stash of veggies. We later found out that the reason they did such a thorough search, was because the owners of the boat that arrived before us, the one with the 'crime scene' tape, were in jail for arriving into the country with undeclared ammunition.  
    % blog/savusavu2.jpg
    & We made lunch, but could not sleep yet, we had fees to pay to the quarantine and health officers and had to go into town to get some money to do it. They told us where to find their respective offices, that Savusavu was a one-street town and that they'd be easy to find. They gave us general direction, we didn't take notes thinking we'd remember, severely overestimating the capabilities of our tired brains. We also moved our boat off the dock and onto a mooring, and pumped some air into Iggy the dinghy before going into town.
    & We were looking for a green building, but none we passed looked like a proper office. This was our first excursion into town, our first look at Fiji. The city, while small, was very animated and busy, there were people everywere. Everyone we passed waved at us, "Bula!" We returned their wave and greeting – by now, we knew bula meant hello. We passed by an area packed with windowless buses, with vendors outside trying to sell its passengers soft drinks and snacks. Wild dogs roamed the streets, we passed a green space with people, sitting while chatting and sharing food. We caught a glimpse of the digicel booth, we'd have to come here later to get some data for our phones. The fresh vegetable market was right next to the bus station, looking very much like the one in Tonga, but bigger, with stalls selling indian staples. We couldn't wait to get some paw paw and breadfruit! The town had many stores: lots of hardware shops selling more or less the same content, a hideously pink grocery store called Max value, a chinese bakery etc. 
    % blog/savusavu5.jpg
    & We arrived at the edge of town then, or the part of town where the street transitions from buildings to bush, and still no health or quarantine office in sight. We remembered them saying that the customs office was on the other side of town, where there were less buildings. This one, we figured, we couldn't miss. We found it straight away, picked up our passports, and asked for directions to the health and quarantine offices again. They assured us that if we kept walking the other way, that we'd find the green building. 
    & Devine and I dragged our tired bodies back over there, and did find a green building. The quarantice office wasn't on the street, but at the back of it. The quarantine officer took a liking to us and we talked for a long while, but our bodies longed for a rest. We must have said goodbye 10 times before he agreed to let us go. He told us how to find the health office – hopefully this time, we wouldn't forget. We walked out, and about 5 minutes into our walk, we realized that we had contradicting information. 
    - "He said it's on the left and past a round-about," I said. 
    - "No, he said it's on the right close to the customs office" 
    & I felt my skin getting warmer, I couldn't believe we'd forgotten again. Dead on our feet, Devine volunteered to return to ask the chatty man about the health office again. 
    & We did eventually find it, but we did forget something again, they couldn't provide change, we had to pay the exact amount. This, they'd told us, although neither of us remembered – a feeling all too familiar at this point. We stood there, ready to drop, I considered faking a tear then too – that's how desperate I was. Our exhaustion must have been obvious to them, because he took pity on us. He went around the office, and asked other employees for change – what a guy, oh what a guy! 
    & On the way out, we stopped by the Digicel booth to get some data. I would have preferred we'd go tomorrow, but Devine insisted on it. We took some amazing shots while becalmed on the ocean during our passage, and Devine wanted to put them online. We'd heard internet in Fiji was cheap, but we didn't expect to get 25G for 25$, this equates to 15$ cad. In Tonga, all we could get was 5G for 25$ (Tongan dollars). We couldn't believe it. The Digicel employees welcomed us to Savusavu, all the while staring at Devine's lip piercings like they weren't of this earth. We had a chat, and told them we came on a yacht, and right then all the employees turned to us. 
    - "Did you hear of the boat with weapons? Do you know what happened?" 
    & The ammunition boat was the talk of the town! They asked us about it and we told them what we knew, amused by how fast news traveled here. We left the stall, data in hand, brains melting, but walked past the market – we'd made enough stops for today. Arriving back on the boat, we made some dinner, I can't remember what we ate because seconds after eating it we passed out. 
    & We're here, and we can sleep for more than 3 hours at a time - oh how grand a feeling!

THE ROCK OF POLYNESIA  
  SETTINGS
    Location : Niue
    Date : 2017-07-29
  Sailing to Niue
    % blog/niue1.jpg
    & {*Niue*}, pronounced 'New-ay', a rock in the pacific, one of the largest coral islands on earth. It's the first country to offer free, state-funded, wireless internet to all its residents and has a goal of being completely {solar powered(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niue)} - uh. Wow?
    & We'd also heard that the school gave all of the kids laptops, this, with free internet, makes it a paradise for game devs. Already then, we made plans to move there, like all places in the tropics with a good connection and supply of coconut and beer. I remember when we were speaking of staying in {*Nuku Hiva*} too, and in La Paz. We make a home everywhere we go. This, makes it hard to leave, but this ease of adaptation also makes us eager to go forward, to see where else we could live. This is what we do, we set up house in different places, sometimes for 8 months at a time. 
    & We weren't going to be staying long in Niue though, but not by choice. 
    & {Alofi Bay(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5901703433945088/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1558751788482)}, the only anchorage on the island, is not protected in any wind other than east. If the wind turns in an unfavourable direction, staying could be dangerous and we'd be forced to leave. 
    & One other troublesome thing about the 'rock of Polynesia', is that they hiked the departure fees from 35$ to 80$ per person. Anyone who enters Niue, when leaving, need pay this fee. That's a lot of money, we thought, to visit a place so small.
    & In the end I'm glad we went, because of all the places we'd been, Niue was our favourite.
    & We arrived at 6am in the morning, rounding the island to Alofi bay that lay on the west side. A squall lay between me and the anchorage, a puffy cloud with a thick wet skirt beneath it. I pulled my hood on, grabbed the helm firmly and quickly skipped through songs on my phone till I landed on anything by Purity ring. Ah! Sea castles. Yes. Perfect. 
    & WOOSH! A gust of wind comes, but I'm ready. The song begins then too. 
    - I could build a machine.
    & The boat heels, but I've got this! 
    - Draw pictures for the walls.
    & Then comes the rain, heavy droplets, washing the salt crystals away. It left as quickly as it came, giving way to the sun, its face reflected in a thousand wet pools on the deck. 
    - Hang up all my fragile frights.
    & I point Pino towards the anchorage. Tall masts ahead, signs of life. The water, a deep blue, as deep as I've ever seen it, spotted with brightly-coloured floaters. 
    - "Display that you may see-" 
    & I sing aloud, turning the music off. 
    - "Devine! We're here!"
    & The sleeper awakens. 
  Arriving to Niue
    & We tethered {Pino(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/boat/4733784360484864/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534132049)} to a mooring, a bright ball, connecting us to the ocean floor. I like to imagine we're an airship sometimes, and that we're afloat, high into the air - being afloat and aloft, the two are all too similar. 
    & The water here is abnormally clear for its depth, water visibility can often reach 60m or more as the coral and limestone filter out sediment in the water. We'd heard that humpback whales swim in the mooring field now and again, how amazing it would be to see them with such clarity! The whales did come, under the cover of night, we could hear them surfacing near the boat but we couldn't see them. The sound of their breathing was pleasant enough. Ah, how I loved the idea of sleeping amongst giants! 
    & Checking into Niue was simple and fast, a rare treat. They picked up Devine at the pier, along with other cruisers that had arrived that same morning, and drove everyone around to various offices to sign and complete some documents.

    & When arriving in a new place, it is customary aboard Pino to make pancakes usually accompanied by maple syrup. We are down to one can. We promised to keep it for our arrival in New Zealand, to celebrate the completion of the 2nd leg of our pacific circumnavigation. Instead of liquid gold, we opted for bitter orange jam instead, not the same, but a good alternative.
    & We kept the radio on that day, and overheard a conversation between two cruisers, one had an unmistakable quebecois accent. The quebecois was speaking to another yachtie, who said they'd checked the grib files (a special binary format of weather data) that morning, and that the weather was supposed to shift to the west. As I mentioned before, staying in this unprotected anchorage in westerlies was a BAD idea. 
    - "It's going to be a real shit fest out here when that weather comes rolling in."
    - "I don't see this on the grib files." The quebecois said.
    - "I'm tellin' ya! Real shit fest. We've got to check out fast."
    & I looked at Devine.
    - "Shit. Does that mean we have to leave? We just got here!"
    & We had checked the weather that same morning and did not see anything coming from the west on the grib files, but now we had doubts. Devine checked again, and saw nothing different.
    - "That can't be right. Looks clear."
    & We could hear them bickering on the radio still, and they agreed to meet on the pier to discuss it further. We thought it a good idea to go, to try and untangle this mess. As it turned out, this was a mistake - phew! Somehow, one of them messed something up while checking the gribs. We had plenty of good weather, and time to explore the island after all!

  The dinghy crane
    & A thing that is unique to Niue, is that the island stands at 60m above sea level at its highest, 30m at its lowest. The pier wasn't nearly that tall, but it rose high enough to making getting onto it difficult. It had stairs carved on one side, to allow people like us to disembark, although these were slippery, and getting on with a running swell required much patience. Because of the constant wave action and current, its safer to hoist dinghies out of the water. A crane is set up on the pier to do just that. Even bigger boats make use of it. If fishermen want to fish, they need to truck their boats over to the pier, and they've got to lower it down into the water with the crane. When done, they've got to bring it back up the same way. No boat stays in the water.
    % blog/niue7.jpg
    & Iggy the dinghy made use of the crane too, and was parked up alongside a few others of its kind. Ours is often the smallest moored onto a pier, Niue was no exception, all the other dinghies were heavier and longer than our Iggy - none though, bore a name as cool.
    & Walking up to the island, we passed the station powering the crane, it was solar-powered. Going up further, we saw showers that were also solar-powered. Um, the rumours were true! Many other businesses were equipped with these wonderfully green devices. 
    & Along the road we spotted a large gaping hole, as if someone had, 'a-la- minecraft', carved blocks out of it. The island is full of these limestone caves and chasms. Many a time, did we argue about the pronunciation of chasm. Ka-zim? Cha-zim? 
    % blog/niue8.jpg
  Alofi 
    & The town of Alofi is on a road which circles the entire island, there are a few other smaller roads that criss-cross the land. We walked to the yacht club to to let them know we'd taken one of their moorings, a young new zealand girl was at the desk. The Commodore was on vacation, she explained, pointing to a guestbook on the desk for us to sign. The guestbook logged every yacht that came to Niue. Looking through, we smiled as we saw the names of boats we knew, now gone. We too left our mark in the log:
    & {*Pino*} was here, July 2017. 
    & The yacht club had an extensive library. We spent much time there, trying to dig up some new books to read. I found a comic by Elise Gravel, funny to find this all the way out here on a tiny island in the pacific. I then saw the name Murakami at the corner of my eye, but it was printed in Polish - damn. I spotted an old 70's vegetarian cooking book, filled with amazing and simple recipes, this one, found a home in our library. Devine was looking for penguin classics, any of them, also hoping to find the elusive 'letters from a stoic' from Seneca. No luck. We asked the stand-in Commodore if she'd been here long.
    - "Not long no, it's hard to get a visa to stay here."
    - "How come?"
    - "Niueans can live in New Zealand, but we can't live in Niue. Makes sense though, it's not a big island and it would change it completely if there were too many Kiwis around."
    & After {cyclone Heta(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Heta)} hit the island in 2004, many Niueans had their houses demolished and left. We saw this for ourselves when driving round to the south, skeletons of houses bordered the road, inhabited by ghosts and chickens. 
    % blog/niue11.jpg
    & During a visit to Hio beach, we spoke to a Niuean who had just returned from living in New Zealand. She started a new business here on the island, a cafe built inside a red container. 
    - "Niueans are coming back, " she said, "it is our home, all we can do is return here."
    & If you're ever on Niue, this cafe serves breadfruit chips, and the best - and cheapest - craft beer you'll find on the islands. Look for Kalaga-lager (try and say this 5 times in a row real fast), a beer made in New Zealand, but ironically, only available in Niue. The beer costs less than 1$ a can, many cruisers left the island with cases of it. If Pino could stand to carry more weight, we too, would have left with more.   
    % blog/niue10.jpg
    & We walked out and continued the tour of our new neighbourhood, although there was no one around. No one walking. Occasionally we'd see a car whizz by, once every 10 minutes. We walked past a small Indian restaurant, a place where we could buy data, a school, not much else. We didn't walk much further than this though, due to the presence of a stray pup who was very, very nippy. We turned around and spotted another stray, this one, not so nippy. We make a point of never touching animals we see on the street, this one was no exception, we walked past and headed over to a path leading down to a beach. The stray followed us there and eventually skipped ahead, it looked back to make sure we were still there.
    % blog/niue9.jpg
    - "Maybe it's a trap." Devine said.
    - "But it looks so friendly." I said, weak to its doggy charms.
    - "Trick of the trade." 
    & We wouldn't have followed this dog into a cave, but walking down some steps to a lovely beach front, we thought, would be safe enough. Besides, the dog had plans of its own, and began to chase something we couldn't see around the beach.
    & The beach had beautiful clear sand, and the water was shallow with a hard coral bottom. I put my feet in it, Devine did this too, but then pointed to a shape moving in the water.
    - "Hey look a sea snake!"
    - "Oh wow! It's coming this way!"
    - "Do sea snakes bites?"
    - "I've no idea."
    - "OH shit. It's swimming faster."
    & We darted back onto the sand, maybe it was very eager to say hello. We didn't stay to find out. I later read that some sea snakes are poisonous, and that a bite results in four weeks of excruciating pain, but not in death - pain, not death. Got it. 
    & We had another encounter with a sea snake, in a place where it was king and us mere floating fleshies. We stood on Hio beach, and stared ahead at the long stretch of shallows we'd have to walk to get to the dive pools. A part of the shallows was soft sand, but most of it had an uneven texture that would make walking painful. Both of us, underprepared as always, were barefoot. We walked together, trying to prove to the other that this was nothing and that our feet weren't really being repeatedly penetrated by many sharp rocks.
    & The water barely covered my knees, then all of sudden, came a hole much deeper. We'd arrived at the pools. The pool had beautiful reef fish swimming in it, and was connected to others by tunnels or openings. We dove in, relieved to give our pained feet a break. The colours were unbelievable, we made a game of chasing each other through the different pools This is how we met the second sea snake. I saw it near me and made a detour to avoid it. Devine was behind me at the time but had not seen it, nor understood why I'd made that particular turn. At that moment too, the snake decided to swim out of its hiding spot. I saw Devine trying to get it to swim somewhere else, pushing walls of water at it with little success. 
    % blog/niue12.jpg
    & We swam away, deciding to leave that particular pool to the sea snake. You win this round too, sea snake. Better to land on this than a moray eel though, I'd read that Niue had a few large ones. During a diving trip in Phuket I nearly touched one by accident, I could have lost a finger to it. 
    & We visited many other sights on the island, it's amazing how many wondrous things there are to see here. We walked a stretch of land bearing thousands of spiked coral carved by wind and sea, leading to a drop, a deep crevasse, with a hidden forest of palms.
    % blog/niue14.jpg
    & We passed under giant arches of rock, around spires jutting out of the ground and into caves with walls so smooth they didn't feel real. We climbed down dark chasms, light in hand, and had a lunch of vegetable pitas in the dark next to a river of black liquid.
    & We swam in many other pools, in crystal clear waters, a mix of salt and fresh that made the surface water blurry. 
    & Sometimes, as we walked in the caves, I would lose sight of Devine. Then moments later, Devine stood 10m above ground on a ledge in that same cave, grinning down at me.
    - "How do you do that...!?"
    & I was reminded of our time in Japan, when we climbed mount Fuji. Devine was always ahead, perched up on a ledge somewhere and waiting for me, always finding some high place to stand from, and doing so with ease. 
    % blog/niue13.jpg
    & We don't get to visit islands so thoroughly usually, since neither of us can drive there are places we just can't go, that is, unless someone offers us a ride. This is how we visited Niue, a place with no public transportation and with a pier that makes it impossible to bring bikes ashore. 
    & We have Leslie and Stu from S/Y Sula to thank for this trip, and for showing us how to open a coconut with a machete. We've since downgraded, cutting them open with a wood knife and a hammer, and I have to say, it's not nearly as cool as when Stu did it in the middle of the road with a long bit of dangerous-looking steel.

INTERNET IN PARADISE  
  SETTINGS
    Location : Huahine, French Polynesia
    Date : 2017-07-01
  Avea Bay in Huahine
    % blog/huahine1.jpg
    & {*Huahine*}, one of the many grouped islands in {French Polynesia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Polynesia)}. Our plans for future ocean voyaging could have ended there though, because we almost crashed onto a reef.
    & Since we always time our arrival with the morning sun, I almost always get the first look of every island. Huahine stood in front of us, a series of volcanic peaks marked by deep valleys and blanketed in green, an island that came into being million of years ago. 
    & We were heading for {Baie d'Avea(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/6560236114542592/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1558750803356)}, to the south of the island. 
  Near-crash onto a reef
    & I'd picked this place, because we'd heard the internet was good - yes, we make decisions based on this a lot. I was worried though, because the bay appeared to be very open to swell. From accounts I'd read online, people said that it was a very protected harbour but looking at the anchorage on Navionics (a navigation app) I didn't believe it was protected. I thought we'd go and see for ourselves. I looked at images of the island online beforehand, but some important details had undoubtedly slipped my mind.
    & Whenever we near land we slow down and scan the horizon with our binoculars to get a look at the entrance. On Navionics, I did see that there was a dotted line around the island, but that's not how this app typically marks reefs or shallows on charts. 
    & Something wasn't right. 
    & Devine looked through the binoculars more carefully, trying to see the state of the water ahead between swells. The waves were curling and crashing onto something... onto a reef, and the water was getting shallower, and shallower.
    - "It's a reef! Dead ahead!"
    & Devine said, hurriedly.
    & We made a hard turn to port, running parallel to it. We had some distance between it and us – but it wasn't far. 
    & Evidently, there was no pass to Baie d'Avea on the south west side of the island.
    & Why did this happen? We had sonar on. In this view, the reef is not marked by a big patch of shallow blues or greens, but by a thin dotted line. I assumed that the light blue patch was a reef, but the lighter white part west of the channel markers was indicative of a pass. In the image below on the left, is the sonarchart (that we had on at the time), and the other is the regular chart view. Usually, sonar offers more precision in maps and it's why we use it. We've learned our lesson. In hindsight, we should have read more about the island rather than to rely completely on our nav app, especially after reading {this article(http://svcrystalblues.blogspot.com/2017/09/navionics-sonar-charts-missing-reef.html)} by another boat reporting the same problem with sonar charts.
    % blog/huahine12.jpg
    & Devine and I couldn't believe it. We were shocked, but glad that we always plan our entrances in the full light of day, and that we trusted our ears and eyes more than the app. We learned later that {many boats crash onto this reef(https://adventuresofatribe.com/2017/07/23/mayday/)}, happy to say that {Pino(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/boat/4733784360484864/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534132049)} was not one of them. There were boats anchored in the bay, we wondered then if they'd seen us pointing toward the reef hoping Huahine wouldn't claim another yacht. 
    & I looked at the chart again - making sure sonar was off this time - to try and see how we could go to Baie D'Avea, without having to jump a reef to get to it. There was one pass, at the very north end of the island. 
    - "It's one hour to the pass, then another hour to get to the bay. Still want to go?" 
    & I asked.
    - "For internet, yes."
    & The things we do for internet.
    & To go to Avea Bay, we had to sail north to get in through the pass, then sail down to the south from inside the reef.
    & Arriving into the north, we could see the small village of {*Fare*}, this is where we would have to go to get groceries. The village bordered the water, a large concrete pier covered the downtown side, a big ship was tied to it with people busy lifting cargo from its deck. This part of the island was relatively flat, lacking in peaks. We moved past it, and began to motor southward toward our anchorage. 
    % blog/huahine8.jpg
    & The pass was long and winding, often shallow, I'd stand at the bow to look at the passing bommies below. The land was hilly and lush. A small road ran along the water, we could see cars coming in and out of view, few cars – this island was small. Some of the shore was lined with rows of pillared-huts, a resort for tourists consisting of little bungalows with thatched roofs.
  Avea Bay
    & We arrived a short hour later into Baie d'Avea, there were few boats here. The bay had moorings. These we'd read, were free. In fact, all moorings on the island were free for anyone to take. We dropped our anchor in 10m of water, right within range of the hotel wifi - perfect.
    & We put Iggy in the water and went over to a pier in front of the hotel. As we neared it, the sea floor rose beneath us and with it blocks of coral and anemones. The water had a healthy population of fish. 
    % blog/huahine10.jpg
    & The famous clown fish remained in the safety of the anemones. Picasso triggerfish hovered near, their faces intricately painted. The yellow moorish idols poked at the coral and sponges with their tubular noses, their head spines dramatically elongated to form a trailing sickle-shaped crest. We couldn't wait to get into the water, to go and see them all up close!
    & The pier looked new, beautifully constructed, a higher part acted as a walk-way to a scenic viewpoint for tourists. A set of stairs lead to a lower part of the pier, where boats could moor their dinghies. At times, this part of the pier was near-submerged. It had shiny new cleats, and the wood was immaculate. 
    % blog/huahine2.jpg
    & We tied Iggy to the low pier and stepped ashore, this pier belongs to the hotel but unlike some other places we were not asked to pay them a fee to tie to it. Another great thing about it, was the presence of a fresh-water shower on the shore annexed to the pier so beach-goers could rinse the salt and sand off after a swim. We made use of it, keeping the fresh water from our tanks for drinking and dishes instead. 
    & Baie d'Avea, and the whole of Huahine isn't completely overrun by tourists. Despite the presence of a resort, the place remains low-key. The resort doesn't claim ownership of the beach front, the locals, yachties and tourists can all come and make use of the pier, the showers and the sandy beach. 
    & We found the password to the wifi with ease, they made no attempt to conceal it and didn't seem to care if we were guests of the hotel or not. 
    % blog/huahine9.jpg
  Internet
    & For the rest of the month, we had wifi from the boat - what a nice change! Everywhere else we'd been so far, we had to take our laptops ashore to get a signal, and this often meant meant having to pay to sit in a bar, or cafe to upload a video, send out a few tweets or download an important file. We don't mind paying for a drink, but if we need to upload a video we have to be there for hours at a time, with no way to charge our laptops. Restaurants, bars and care rarely provide this service, and will often refuse use of their outlets. Uploading anything then becomes a 3-day endeavour, sitting outside, while mosquitoes make a meal of our flesh.
    & Now, we get to stay on Pino to do these tasks, and we can spend our visits ashore taking walks and swimming rather than turning it into computer time. On occasion though, as the wind shifts to the south, Pino would get pushed just out of wifi range. We laughed at this, checking the weather for the next day to see if we could have wifi on the boat or not.
    & Our wifi is wind dependent. 
    & WOOSH! Pino swings to the south. 5 bars. 
    & WOOSH! Pino swings back to the north. 2 bars – damn!
    & I was able to update my ipad, to get an app that would permit me to use it as a drawing station. We also uploaded videos to our channel - yep, the connection was that good! 
    % blog/huahine3.jpg
  The best anchorage in Polynesia
    & Internet aside, this turned out to be our favourite anchorage in Polynesia. The water was clear and calm, there was little noise or traffic. We spent a lot of time in the water, floating on the surface and facing down, looking at the stingrays gliding in the depths. They moved effortlessly, their pectoral fins undulating and propelling them forward. 
    & Everytime we thought we saw a turtle, we'd scream it aloud so the other would hear.
    - "TURTLE!"
    & It was almost never a turtle. 
    & Turtle heads poking out of the water resemble coconut shells. We're confident though, that at least one of those coconut shells was a turtle, coconut shells typically don't submerge at will.
    % blog/huahine6.jpg
    & Devine & I were never that comfortable swimming around the boat before. We did fine in pools, but otherwise diving into a big space full of living creatures was a frightening experience. Bit by bit, I swam further, and Devine deeper. We became creatures of the ocean.
    & Fish arent as frightful as land creatures, its crazy how close you can get without them making any effort to avoid you. Walking into a forest, you're lucky if you can spot anything at all, but in the water very few hide, most will swim close or near you. 
    % blog/huahine5.jpg
    & We took Iggy out to the outer reef once in a while. There wasn't much on the sea floor, just small blocks of coral, and a lot of darkly-tinted sea cucumbers. An infinity of leathery sea pickles, a horrid mine field of sunken turds - not very appealing. When you think of the south pacific, this isn't the image that comes to mind. 
    & Going ashore didn't offer much in terms of sight-seeing, aside from the resort, there was not much else around. A 30 min walk away, was a tiny shop that sold canned goods, mostly canned fish and corned beef. They had some dry snacks, a limited set of toiletries and no fresh foods, aside from some sad, sad onions. Some days they said they had potatoes and greens, but we never saw any on the shelves. The road-side to the shop was full of coconut trees, the shells lining the road. 
    & The small shops never had much, that is, unless we walked in with the goal of buying an endless supply of corned beef. If we wanted to get more fresh foods, we'd have to take the boat back up to Fare in the north of the island. We took Pino back there once, only to re-supply, and hurried right back down to Baie d'Avea. It's so much nicer there, there's always room to anchor and it's calm - so, so, calm. 
  The town of Fare
    & Fare is one of the nicer French Polynesian villages we've visited, the U supermarket has a good supply of everything. Although, it's important to always check inside packaging when buying dried goods. One day, Devine bought a bag of rice kept in a thick paper bag, when we opened it that same day we saw it had an entire eco system living in it, an advanced civilization of moths. The same happened when buying dried pasta in plastic bags, sometimes we'd find things living in it. A lot of times, the bugs didn't enter the bag after, but came with it in the form of eggs. A warm environment makes it real easy for these eggs to hatch, it is virtually impossible to completely remove all traces of insects from raw agricultural grain foods, which is how the weevils (or their eggs) got there in the first place. 
    % blog/huahine7.jpg
    & The idea is to either eat it all before the eggs hatch, or to freeze or heat the grains prior to storing them to kill the eggs. Being lazy, and lacking a fridge, we don't do these things, we just pick our packaging carefully, avoiding paper and cardboard and opting for thick plastic whenever possible. If the bugs are already in the grain, there is little that can be done. While we would prefer to avoid plastic, in the tropics not having plastic means your food will likely be infested with bugs. We had this happen many times: opening a box of couscous, only to find a moth flying out of it, or cutting open a bulb of garlic, again, to find hatchlings hiding in there. We've had our share of insect troubles. I spent many evenings sifting creepy-crawlies out of rice, or flour, with a bowl and strainer. In a place were food is costly, and scarce, we let go of our disdain of such things. If only our past selves could see us now. 
    - "So future Rekka, what did you last night?""
    - "Oh you know - same old, same old. Sifted bugs out of my rice for 3 hours."
    & The smile on past Rekka's face disappears.
    - ಠ╭╮ಠ
    & Still think we're living the dream?
    & You have the weigh the good against the bad, insects in food sucks, because I like food and prefer it bug-free, but being able to swim with angel fish, trumpet fish and octopus is very, very good.  
    & We could have lost our home to a reef, not many can say this or imagine what that's like. You can take your home anywhere with you, and that's amazing, but it means getting it through difficult places. There is always a risk involved. A beautiful risk. 
    % blog/huahine11.jpg
    & This is where we spent our last month in French polynesia, admiring with child-like fascination every living thing around us, every bird and fish, etched into our minds. 
    & Yes, yes – even the disgusting sea cucumbers.

  Nuku Hiva in French Polynesia
    % blog/nukuhiva1.jpg
    & {*Nuku Hiva*}, a green island in the pacific, straight out of Jurassic Park. Just as foreign and just as wild, except instead of hungry lizards there are hungry, angry mosquitoes.
    & I had no idea what it was going to be like there, I'd barely read anything about it. I knew where we'd anchor, that people there spoke french and that there would be baguettes, but beyond that it was a blur, a black spot in my mind. I read the book {*Fourteen*} during our 28-day transit from La Paz. In this book, the family had sailed to Nuku Hiva, but all in all their experience there was not so good. It wasn't made bad because of the Marquesans, or the island itself, but because of no-no's – little bugs that bite that hide in sand. I took a mental note of this:
    & "Avoid sand beaches and you will have a great time!"
    % blog/nukuhiva13.jpg
    & {Pino(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/boat/4733784360484864/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1557534132049)} arrived at the entrance to {Taiohae bay(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5690458764214272/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1558533207558)}. I sat on the bow with Iggy's deflated corpse, I pumped life back into it, while it, seemed to draw the life out of me. I was sweating, a constant stream oozing down my back. We had no dinghy pump. We broke it ages ago. All we had was a jury-rigged contraption using a bike pump, a bike tube and the hose from the old pump. It worked, but it took twice as long to put air into anything.
    & A super yatch was anchored in the mouth of the bay, its name was 'Ethereal'. 
    - "How fitting." I thought.
    & It's as if the yatch was a sign, a warning of the view to come – one, that is definitely ethereal.
    & A chain of mountains, green and fuzzy, and ahead a bay filled with boats flying flags from all over the world. We found a spot in 12m of water, mud bottom, and dropped anchor. The sky was clear, but clouds clung to the peaks of every mountain. It was a rare thing, we realized afterwards, for the skies to be clear. Most days were grey. While grey often means rain, it also means less sun. It was over 30 degrees every day, so hot that at times we couldn't work, our bodies shiny with sweat, driving us mad. Mad to the point that we seriously considered flooding the cockpit with water to turn it into a pool. 
    % blog/nukuhiva12.jpg
  Our routine
    & Everyday, we'd get up with the sun. The mornings were cooler, but around 10am, when it was too warm in the boat we went ashore to work from the snack bar. Snack Vaeki was an open-air restaurant with seating outside, the kitcken was in a tiny building with a counter. There were with many tables, occupied by locals but most of all by boaters. There was free internet there, but getting something to drink or to eat was encouraged. We would always get the same thing, a freshly squeezed glass of pamplemousse juice. Pamplemousse is nothing like the grapefruit we have in Canada, they're 3 times as big, green inside and out, and sweet-tasting. The seating area was covered with a plastic canopy, euro-style outlets hung on every post, sharing the space with stalks of bananas. 
    % blog/nukuhiva11.jpg
    & Many animals would hang around the snack bar, dogs lay under the tables, hiding from the sun, but these did little to shield them from the constant onslaught of flies. There were also chickens, lot of chickens and roosters. I thought roosters only crowed in the morning, but no, they crow for no reason, at all hours of the day, endless b'gawking and cluck-clucking. We'd also seen horses walk around, but they didn't care to hang around the pier and much preferred nibbling on bits of tall grass further inland.
    & We sat at the Snack everyday, catching a bit of internet before everyone else would come ashore to use it. Uploading anything was a challenge. We found an internet lounge in the village, a small building with walls covered in popular (but old) xbox and playstation titles. There were tables, with a few old computers, televisions and consoles. Kids sat playing games, while 3 giant fans helped to cool the place down. The owner was friendly, we got along well enough, so much that he let us leave our laptop there overnight to get a big file online. It took 3 days to upload a 10 minute video, and this is with, apparently, the fastest internet on the island. Many locals would come to the internet place to ask for movies, or series. Even all the way out here, people follow game of thrones, the walking dead, or other popular media.

    & Even if it was really hot, we didn't swim here. It rained everyday, and the run-off from the mountain made the water brown and unclear. It wasn't inviting. And not just this, the first day when we took the dinghy ashore, we noticed a lot of angry splish-splashing near the concrete pier, then our eyes moved to someone, tossing bits of something pinkish into the water...
    & Then I saw fins. 
    & And tails.
    & Sharks. Many sharks.
    & While I think them wonderful, my monkey brain still fears teeth. 
    & Devine and I gulped. We cared little to swim after that, even after seeing kids leaping off that same pier for a swim a few hours later.
    - "We led sheltered lives haven't we?" 
    & Devine said, wide-eyed still.
    & These kids were fearless. They made a game of it, just like they made a game of swimming where the waves break on the shore. The island doesn't have a reef, so when the tide and wind-driven waves come in, the water races to shore, unhindered, and explodes onto the sea wall with a cloud CLAP! There was no beach there, at low-tide the bottom was just mud and rocks, mostly rocks, polished after years of being caressed by the sea. The waves hitting the wall were considerable, even so, the kids took to the sea! They grabbed street signs, bits of wood, whatever they could find that could be used as a body-board, then they'd sit in the water, waiting for the waves to come. The waves always did come, and buried them all in an instant. The kids laughed, they'd played this game a hundred times.
    & We were impressed, and again, felt we'd led very sheltered lives.
  Polynesian languages
    & The people in Nuku Hiva are exceptionally nice. Because we could speak french, we had an edge over those who couldn't, it was easier to befriend locals, a lot of them even recognized our accent. 
    - "You're from Quebec!" 
    & They would say in french.
    - "Yea, from Montreal!" 
    - "I love the the accent!"
    - "Poutine. Bobette. Tabarnak." 
    & While the locals speak French, they also speak Marquesan, a language of many vowels. When first seeing it written down, I remembered a song in 'national lampoon's christmas vacation', the scene when Clark imagines a woman on a diveboard, about to dive in his imaginary pool. A song is playing in the background, it goes: "Mele kalikimaka." 
    & It was very similar to the writing I'd seen in the village. I wondered then, is Hawaiian that different from Marquesan? The two sets of islands are so close! After much reading, I found out that both fall under central eastern polynesian, which is sub-divided into Marquesic – encompassing Marquesan AND Hawaiian – and Tahitic. All Polynesian languages show strong similarity, particularly in vocabulary. 'Mele kalikimaka' is Hawaiian, and means 'merry christmas', or at least that's what the song says it means. I learned then, that the only central eastern polynesian words I knew were actually the Hawaiian equivalent of katakana in Japanese. The polynesians had no notion of religion or christmas, that is, until the missionaries arrived. Because the word didn't exist, Hawaiians opted for a phonetic translation of merry christmas instead of making a new word for it.
    & But now, I was down to knowing no Polynesian at all, Hawaiian or Marquesan, but that changed quickly enough. When walking down the street, people smiled at us and said:
    - "La Orana!"
    & Which we promptly repeated, and which means "Hello!". This word is similar in all central eastern polynesian countries:
    & French polynesia - La orana! (yo-rah-nah)
    & Cook islands - Kia orana!
    & New Zealand - Kia ora!
    & We did mix these up on occasion, we always counted on the fact that they'd assumed we said the correct thing. In doubt, you could say the words quickly, under your breath, no one would know, or if they did, they were too damn polite to say anything about it.
  Tattoos
    & Marquesans are really keen on tattoos, a lot of people had them, and were very pleased to see ours! A lot of foreigners come here to get tattoos, including an old salt we met, the captain of a 70-foot steel boat. If you asked him about tattoos, he would tell you, in a broken english accent, that he cared little for them. Don't ask me how, but he ended up with some ink on his shoulder, even then, he wasn't too fond of my black-out tattoo.
    - "What does it mean?" 
    & He asked me one day.
    - "It has no meaning, it's purely aesthetic,"
    & Then, after realizing that I'd reached the limit of his english, I simplified.
    - "It means nothing, I just like it."
    & He spoke good enough french, but whenever I tried to talk to him his eyes went real small, as if doing this would sharpen his hearing. I always spoke to him in french first, but I'd switch to english afterwards – it's entirely possible that my accent was just too pronounced. He always did understand me in the end. The answer I gave him, about the meaning of my tattoo, in simple english, displeased him, and he began to lecture me on how silly it was to bear something permanent on your person that had no meaning. People love to lecture me about this, and I love to ignore them.

  Fruits and vegetables
    & In the afternoon, after spending the first part of the day at the Snack, we went on walks around the island. The place had fruit trees at every corner, bearing mangos, papayas, sugar apples, coconut, pamplemousse, passion fruit and breadfruit. All of the houses were camouflaged in green, there was plenty to eat on their property. It is why in some places it was hard to find fruit, stores just don't sell them because the locals have no need of them. There was a market near the concrete pier that sold fruit, frequented by those who came on boats, planes or cruiseships. The market sold fresh vegetables too, brought by cargo ships every week. On days when the cargo ships arrived, the stands were full of fresh produce, many of them in high demand and of short supply. If you wanted tomatoes, you had to get up early at 5am to get them. We didn't care to do that. We bought local fruit instead, fresh papaya makes a good substitute for tomatoes in {bruschetta(http://grimgrains.com/#papaya+bruschetta+topping)}. Our staples were eggplant, sweet potato, daikon radish and cabbage. 
    % blog/nukuhiva15.jpg
    & We soon adopted the local produce too, like {breadfruit(http://grimgrains.com/#breadfruit)}, there is so much to say about this humble plant. It is a species of the jackfruit family, it has a potato-like flavour, but the more ripe it is the sweeter the taste. {Breadfruit(http://grimgrains.com/Breadfruit)} is a good medium, and can be made into a number of things, we experimented a lot with this during our stay in the islands. Many of the locals looked at us funny when we asked to buy them.
    - "Breadfruit? That's what my grandparents eat."
    & Not so cool with the youngsters apparently.
  Dengue fever
    & During our walks on the island, we almost always regretted walking so far because of how warm it was. The deeper you walk, the more humid, and the less wind there is, and the more you ooze. A walk to the hardware store, or to the pharmacy, always resulted in us coming back looking like we'd gone for a swim. 
    & It's during one of these walks, that Devine contracted dengue fever. Devine had bad headaches and muscle pains, sleeping was difficult and moving was near impossible at times. We'd read about dengue and knew what it was, plus the symptoms matched up, but we weren't sure and it worried us, and so Devine went to the hospital to get a second opinion. On return, a 300$ bill to be paid in hand, Devine appeared confused.
    - "They didn't say I had dengue, but made me take scans, thinking the pains I had were maybe due to scoliosis."
    - "What? That makes NO sense."
    - "No. It really doesn't."
    & Devine did have dengue, but the hospital didn't want to diagnose anyone with it. The reason for that was simple, if there is a certain number of reports, they have to declare an epidemic, which can in turn, scare all of the visitors away. Dengue is bad for business, and the polynesians depend on tourism. I understand this, Devine was healthy otherwise and in no real risk, but did wish they hadn't billed us 300$ to cover up the lie.
    % blog/nukuhiva16.jpg
    & Everyone in the bay knows when a cruiseship is coming, because the locals make a show of it, dressing in traditional wear and playing music. The cruiseships, the blue whale equivalent of Pino, ferry people back and forth in vessels that resemble little space shuttles, they do this all day, to and fro, morning till evening. The tourists look like tourists, pale, camera or ipad in hand, they'd buy their souvenirs, something authentic, take tours around the island and then return to their ocean castle. 
    & Going to work at the Snack was a bad idea with a cruiseship around, it was crowded with tourists, all trying to skype to their family, a continent or two away, while in the background, chickens comically clucked and b'gawked extra harder – I suspected they knew what they were doing. 
    & Devine did recover from dengue, but days later spotted a good friend who suffered the same. The hospital said the same thing, about it not being dengue, minus the warning about it possibly being scoliosis. 
    & We stayed in Nuku Hiva for a long while, which permitted us to start and complete the production of our book {Thousand rooms(https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/thousand-rooms)}. It wasn't easy to work on this here, we seriously overerestimated our tolerance to warm weather, but we got it done still! Our open-air office, Snack Vaeki, wasn't such a bad place to work from after all, we had unlimited pamplemousse juice and the company of other sailors.
  Diesel run
    & By the end of the month, we were getting restless, and decided to move to the next bay. Before doing that, we had to get some diesel. Getting diesel was not the easiest, we took our dinghy to another concrete pier at low tide (due to poor planning). Concrete piers don't float up and down but stay right where they are, to our great displeasure, we had a 6-foot ladder to climb to get onto it. I brought a rope, figured we could lower the jerry cans down into the dinghy that way. First, we got all 4 cans up, and tied Iggy to a step in the ladder. We had them filled up at the gas station, just a short walk away. 
    & I stood on the pier while Devine was in the dinghy below, I tied a rope to the handle of the first jerry can and lowered it, while Devine was trying to keep Iggy steady in the waves. We dropped none, operation diesel-pickup was a success.

  Daniel's Bay
    & We also had to fill our water, {Daniel's bay(https://www.noforeignland.com/home/map/place/5083436372983808/?sid=6547291309604864&tc=1558533871977)} was just a short sail away and was the best place to do it. The anchorage was beautiful, smaller, with high cliffs on one side, if you looked carefully you could see goats walking on its ridges, we could hear them too, bleating in succession. We asked our neighbour, a german sailor, where to get water. He smiled, and told us that he was going there now.
    - "You'll have to follow me very closely, many rocks in the entrance, and current, and waves. Do like me, and you'll be okay."
    & We followed him into the mouth of the river. There was a lot of current and swell, and the water was shallow, if we weren't careful we'd end up on the rocks for sure. The german guy was ahead of us, proceeding slowly, every now and then he pulled up his outboard, avoiding rocks no doubt. We mirrored his movements.
    - "Do like him, yes. He knows. He must know!" 
    % blog/nukuhiva7.jpg
    & We said to ourselves, nervously, all the while wondering how it is he knew where the rocks were. The water wasn't any clearer here. We preferred not to dwell on this, not because it made us nervous, but because we had to focus on what was happening now. We went past the ugly bit of the river, and arrived into the calm bit, relieved. The river was long and narrow, bordered by many trees, it felt like being on the Amazon. Not that I've been on the Amazon, say, it's my mind's memory of a film about what it was like to be on the Amazon. 
    % blog/nukuhiva8.jpg
    & The german guy arrived near a grassy shore, and tied the dinghy to a tree. We did the same.
    - "Watch your head you two, you die if you get hit in the head by a falling coconut."
    & We looked up at the top of the tree we had moored onto, and there was, indeed, a lot of them up there, waiting to kill us perhaps, we thought, or maybe they just didn't feel like it today.
    & There was a tap nearby, just a pipe sticking out of the ground with a faucet at the end of it. It didn't belong there at all. It looked like an anomaly, a glitch in the matrix.
    - "Water is very clean, very good. Best water in french polynesia!" 
    & The german guy said. Soon, a Marquesan named Paul joined us, a jolly and friendly-looking fellow. Our guide and he knew each other, in fact, the german guy gave him a hinano beer, which they cracked opened in front of us. Paul explained that the water came from the mountain, and as the german guy had said, many times already, it was very good and very clean. 
    - "You sell fruit here?" We then asked.
    - "Yes, yes! Oh! I like your tattoos! Come, I'll introduce you to my uncle, he likes tattoos too!"
    % blog/nukuhiva.10.jpg
    & He also said he'd take us to pick some fruit, all from trees on his property, which was the queen's land – or something along those lines. We walked up to an old house, with skulls attached to the wood beams, and other trinkets hanging about. This was his uncle's house. The first thing we saw upon entering, was a kitten on a leash.
    - "Uncle?"
    & But Uncle turned out to be human after all – how boring. 
    & Paul appeared older than Uncle, we wondered then if we'd misunderstood something, we never did find out. Uncle had long black hair, tied into a high bun, and of course, he had tattoos. He shook our hand, but didn't say much, in fact, the cat had meowed more than he'd spoken. 
    % blog/nukuhiva9.jpg
    & Now both began to walk around the property, picking fruits for us. Uncle climbed up a tree, while Paul used a long stick to pick off mangos. In the end, we had about 10 pamplemousses, 2 papayas, 6 mangos, 3 soursops and 1 giant stalk of bananas. I looked at the stalk of bananas, trying to imagine how many banana breads I'd have to make once they'd all decide to ripen at the same time, because that's what bananas do, they synchronize, they enjoy the look of terror on our faces as their skin gets spottier, and darker with every passing day. 
    & Iggy was very full then, with much water and fruit, we were ready for our transit to the Tuamotus. We had to ride in the ugly part of the river again to get to Pino, without our german guide this time. We managed well enough, our eyes widening with every coming swell. What a shame it would be, if all of these fruits fell into the deep.
    & Our time in Nuku Hiva was at an end, but other islands and challenges lay ahead.
    & {Watch a video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raCuLpJRqTY)} of our time in {*Nuku Hiva*}.
