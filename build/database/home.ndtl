ABOUT
  The Rabbits
    & We are {Rekka(https://kokorobot.ca)} & {Devine(https://xxiivv.com)}, two unlikely sailors.
    % content/profile.about.jpg
    & Rekka is an illustrator, writer, admirer of seabirds and purveyor of fungi. Devine is a programmer, artist and musician, a tireless creative, pasta monarch, and fervent believer in {open-source content(mission)}. Together, we created {*HundredRabbits*}, our studio on the water. 
    & We are fueled by plants, and powered by the sun. 
  Story 
    & In January 2016, we left the cold of Montreal and moved west to British Columbia, there, we purchased our sailboat <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Pino/blob/master/README.md' target='_blank'>Pino</a>. Keep in mind, we were a pair of city kids with limited outdoor experience, and neither of us had ever stepped onto a sailboat before.
    & So {why a sailboat(Buying a sailboat)}? In 2012 we moved to Japan, there, we worked on our first games {Hiversaires(https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/hiversaires)} and {Oquonie(http://oquonie.100r.co)} (the latter was completed in Thailand). We love how those travel experiences impacted our projects. After we returned to Canada, we decided that traveling best fueled our work and so we looked at our options. Moving to a new country means selling all you have, we have done this countless times (and are tired of it). We had heard of people living on sailboats like SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF9TNM9R-iw'>Lizzy Belle</a> (David Wellsford), SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkaH_UUH0Ek'>Daphne</a> (Terese Carey) and SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYfFeySHGN4DPrOc9So7PA'>Karl</a> (Nike Steiger), and became obssessed with the idea. Lack of experience aside, we thought that being in a mobile studio would help us accomplish our desire to travel while having a stable home.
    & Since then, we have left Canada and have sailed down the american west coast and over to Mexico. After that, we made the big jump across the pacific to French Polynesia, and crossed the wondrous south pacific islands over to New Zealand. We have since left the lower latitudes and sailed up to Fiji, the Marshall Islands and then over to Japan (where we are now). We planning on staying here for a little while, experiencing Japan by sea! We have become true digital nomads, we share our experience in the form of monthly videos; all the while, creating art, tools, books and games.
  Goal
    & Our {goal(mission)} is to keep moving, while continuing to work on {cool stuff(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/)}. We document our travels as we go, our aim is to learn as much as we can about {(sailing)}, the world, about {offgrid living(off the grid)}; to have a small ecological footprint, and to share knowledge and have it be available to all.

MISSION
  Open Source
    & We created {*Hundred Rabbits*} with the goal of building an audience that could sponsor the creation of high-quality free content, and making it available to those who could otherwise not afford it. We figured that if we made enough to travel and to feed ourselves, we could gradually dedicate more time onto these passion projects.
    % blog/vberth.jpg
    & While we have not yet reached that goal, we have definitely moved closer to it. Our combined revenue of {Patreon(http://patreon.com/100)}, and {Itch(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io)}, now allows us to invest increasingly more time to the creation of original projects such as {Wiktopher(http://wiktopher.kokorobot.ca)}, {Grimgrains(http://grimgrains.com)}, {Dotgrid(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Dotgrid)}, {Left(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/left)} and now {Orca(http://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca)}. To the creation of content, we have also allocated time to contributing and maintaining the open source projects of others. Via our travel diaries on Youtube, we're hoping to keep on growing toward that ideal position, where we could afford to release our entire catalog of games and books, for free.
    & {Dotgrid(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Dotgrid)}, like {Left(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Left)}, was originally created to be used internally, but has now grown into something used by thousands of creators. The development of the application was done following the {Bazaar Model(http://wiki.xxiivv.com/the+bazaar+model)}, as opposed to the {Cathedral Model(http://wiki.xxiivv.com/the+cathedral+model)}, in which the source code is developed over the Internet in view of the public. It allowed for a {conversation(https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Dotgrid/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed)} to occur between us and other Dotgrid users, seeing how differently each person used the tool revealed new directions toward which we could grow the software, and in return, new ways for us to use it as well.
    & Through these exchanges, we've encountered amazing people who've made projects possible, which would not have existed otherwise, and these people have grown into friends and collaborators. 
    & Our intermitent internet connection makes for unpredictable release patterns, and spotty technical support, but allowing users to fix their issues while we are away, encouraged people to learn, and to help each other, find solutions, and submit revisions for everyone to enjoy. 

PINO
  A house with wings
    & Our sailboat is a Yamaha33, a 1982 masthead sloop fiberglass sailboat.

SUPPORT
  A studio on a sailboat
    & The idea of a nomadic design studio, we decided, was the best way to stay creative; seeing new people and places enriches our work. We created our two first games ({Hiversaires(#hiversaires)} and {Oquonie(#oquonie)}) while in Tokyo and Thailand, and love how those experiences impacted our projects. It is something we want to continue to do, and being in a studio that moves will help us accomplish that.
