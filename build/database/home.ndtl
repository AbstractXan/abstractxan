ABOUT US
  The Rabbits
    & We are {Rekka(https://kokorobot.ca)} & {Devine(https://xxiivv.com)}, two unlikely sailors.
    % content/profile.about.jpg
    & Rekka is an illustrator, writer, admirer of seabirds and purveyor of fungi. Devine is a programmer, artist and musician, a tireless creative, pasta monarch, and fervent believer in {open-source content(mission)}. Together, we created {*HundredRabbits*}, our studio on the water. 
  Why a boat?
    & In January 2016, we left the cold of Montreal and moved west to British Columbia, there, we purchased our sailboat <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Pino/blob/master/README.md' target='_blank'>Pino</a>. Keep in mind, we were a pair of city kids with limited outdoor experience, and neither of us had ever stepped onto a sailboat before.
    & So {why a sailboat(Buying a sailboat)}? In 2012 we moved to Japan, there, we worked on our first games {Hiversaires(https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/hiversaires)} and {Oquonie(http://oquonie.100r.co)} (the latter was completed in Thailand). 
    & We love how those travel experiences impacted our projects. After we returned to Canada, we decided that traveling best fueled our work and so we looked at our options. Moving to a new country means selling all you have, we have done this countless times (and are tired of it). We had heard of people living on sailboats like SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF9TNM9R-iw'>Lizzy Belle</a> (David Wellsford), SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkaH_UUH0Ek'>Daphne</a> (Terese Carey) and SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYfFeySHGN4DPrOc9So7PA'>Karl</a> (Nike Steiger), and became obssessed with the idea. Lack of experience aside, we thought that being in a mobile studio would help us accomplish our desire to travel while having a stable home.
  Our path
    & Since then, we have left Canada and have sailed down the American West Coast and over to Mexico. After that, we made the big jump across the pacific to French Polynesia, and crossed the wondrous south pacific islands over to New Zealand. We have since left the lower latitudes and sailed up to Fiji, the Marshall Islands and then over to Japan (where we are now). We planning on staying here for a little while, experiencing Japan by sea! We share our experience in the form of monthly videos, creating art, tools, books and games.
  Lifestyle experiment
    & We learned many things while traveling, namely, the value of water, the effect of salt water corrosion on hardware and the necessity to reduce our power consumption. This has led us to change how we work: 
    & 1. We make our own tools. We decided to make our own apps, that consume less power/memory and that suit our exact needs (Left, Dotgrid, Orca etc).
    & 2. We size projects per location. If we are somewhere off-grid, with little internet, we will work on projects that are smaller. For example, we may choose to make a book instead of a game.
    & 3. We work on low-power, repairable hardware. We work on computers for a living, but running two power-hungry macbooks full-time on an off-grid system doesn't work. In response to this, we now use {raspberry Pi(raspberry)} computers for writing and for development. They are easy to repair, cheap (good for redundancy) and draw little power.
  Goal
    & Our {goal(mission)} is to keep moving, while continuing to work on {cool stuff(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/)}. We document our travels as we go, our aim is to learn as much as we can about {(sailing)}, the world and {offgrid living(off the grid)}. We want to create of high-quality free content, and to make it available to those who could otherwise not afford it.

LIBRARY
  Pino book club
    % content/sailboat.library.jpg
    & When the weather permits, we read a lot on passage. We first started "The Pino book club" during our transit from Mexico to the Marquesas. During nightwatches we'd read and discuss them the next morning over coffee. It was one of our favorite things to do. We also did this with podcasts. Here is a list of the books we've read during passages.

MISSION
  Open Source
    & We created {*Hundred Rabbits*} with the goal of building an audience that could sponsor the creation of high-quality free content, and making it available to those who could otherwise not afford it. We figured that if we made enough to travel and to feed ourselves, we could gradually dedicate more time onto these passion projects.
    % blog/vberth.jpg
    & While we have not yet reached that goal, we have definitely moved closer to it. Our combined revenue of {Patreon(http://patreon.com/100)}, and {Itch(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io)}, now allows us to invest increasingly more time to the creation of original projects such as {Wiktopher(http://wiktopher.kokorobot.ca)}, {Grimgrains(http://grimgrains.com)}, {Dotgrid(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Dotgrid)}, {Left(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/left)} and now {Orca(http://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca)}. To the creation of content, we have also allocated time to contributing and maintaining the open source projects of others. Via our travel diaries on Youtube, we're hoping to keep on growing toward that ideal position, where we could afford to release our entire catalog of games and books, for free.
    & {Dotgrid(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Dotgrid)}, like {Left(http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Left)}, was originally created to be used internally, but has now grown into something used by thousands of creators. The development of the application was done following the {Bazaar Model(http://wiki.xxiivv.com/the+bazaar+model)}, as opposed to the {Cathedral Model(http://wiki.xxiivv.com/the+cathedral+model)}, in which the source code is developed over the Internet in view of the public. It allowed for a {conversation(https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Dotgrid/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed)} to occur between us and other Dotgrid users, seeing how differently each person used the tool revealed new directions toward which we could grow the software, and in return, new ways for us to use it as well.
    & Through these exchanges, we've encountered amazing people who've made projects possible, which would not have existed otherwise, and these people have grown into friends and collaborators. 
    & Our intermitent internet connection makes for unpredictable release patterns, and spotty technical support, but allowing users to fix their issues while we are away, encouraged people to learn, and to help each other, find solutions, and submit revisions for everyone to enjoy. 

PINO
  A house with wings
    & Our sailboat is a Yamaha33, a 1982 masthead sloop fiberglass sailboat. 
    % content/sailboat.boat.jpg
    - {*Name*}: PINO
    - {*Builder*}: Yamaha
    - {*Year*}: 1982
    - {*Length*}: 33'(10 meters)
    - {*Engine*}: Yanmar / diesel(13 HP)
    - {*Hull*}: Fiberglass
    - {*Keel*}: Fin
    & Why Pino? Pino is the name of an android in the anime Ergo Proxy. 'Hundredrabbits' is inspired from an imaginary sailboat (also, frome Ergo proxy) named the 'centzon totochtin', or 'four hundred rabbits'.

COOKING
  A floating kitchen
    % content/cooking.4.jpg
  Why is cooking important to us?
    @ "The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will instruct his patient in the care of the human frame in diet and in the cause and prevention of diseases." | Thomas Edison, 1903
    & Cooking is another creative outlet, not unlike drawing or writing. We find joy in it, as it's an activity that we can do together which we believe is essential for well-being. 
  What do we eat?
    % content/cooking.2.jpg
    & Our diet consists solely of local plants (legumes, fruits, grains, seeds, vegetables etc), meaning that our meals depends highly on our location, for example, in Nuku Hiva (Marquesas) we had no access to tomatoes, so instead, we used papaya to make {bruschetta(https://grimgrains.com/index.html#papaya+bruschetta+topping)}. We look at the adaption to, and adoption of, local produce, as an exercise in creativity. Most processed food will come thickly packaged, and so to limit our waste, we tend to avoid them. 
    & Below is a list of rules that we go by, when it comes to choosing what to eat:
    & 1. Eat varied foods. Biodiversity in the diet means less monoculture in the fields.
    & 2. Pay more. Spend more for foods grown or raised less intensively and with more care, eat less.
    & 3. Eat mostly plants. Especially leafy greens. Cook, and if you can, plant a garden.
    & 4. Avoid processed foods. Donâ€™t eat anything your great-great-grandparents wouldnâ€™t recognize as food. Avoid food products with unpronounceable ingredients, aim for less than five in number.

  Our galley
    % content/cooking.3.jpg
    & Our galley is small, but has enough room for two people to cook. We have a 3 burner gimbled stove, equipped with a large oven. We go out shopping for fresh food almost everyday, since Pino has no refrigeration. In long passages, we rely on dehydrated foods and dried legumes.
    & We have chosen durable(stainless steel, quality wood), multi-functional and simple (unibody, non-electric) {tools(https://grimgrains.com/#tools)}.
  Grimgrains
    % content/cooking.jpg
    & Grimgrains is our {cooking blog(http://grimgrains.com)}, it showcases our favourite creations, along with hand-drawn illustrations for each ingredient. 
    & We started Grimgrains to teach ourselves how to cook. This blog, which now doubles as a travel diary, helps measure our progress, it's also a way to share what we've learned. 
  Why plants?
    & We eat a plants-based diet for {health, ethical and environmental reasons(https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Should_we_go_vegan%3F)}. 
    & Appropriately planned plant-based diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.

SUPPORT
  A studio on a sailboat
    & The idea of a nomadic design studio, we decided, was the best way to stay creative; seeing new people and places enriches our work. We created our two first games ({Hiversaires(#hiversaires)} and {Oquonie(#oquonie)}) while in Tokyo and Thailand, and love how those experiences impacted our projects. It is something we want to continue to do, and being in a studio that moves will help us accomplish that. 
    & We also enjoy the challenges that come with living on a sailboat, the power limitations and reduced connectivity has re-shaped how we work â€” in a good way.
