ABOUT
  The Rabbits
    & We are <b>Rekka</b> & <b>Devine</b>, two unlikely sailors. In January 2016 we left the cold of Montreal and moved west to British Columbia, there, we purchased our sailboat <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Pino/blob/master/README.md' target='_blank'>Pino</a>. Keep in mind, we were a pair of city kids with limited outdoor experience, and neither of us had ever stepped onto a sailboat before.

    & So {{why a sailboat|Buying a sailboat}}? In 2012 we moved to Japan, there, we worked on our first games Hiversaires and Oquonie (the latter was completed in Thailand). We love how those travel experiences impacted our projects. After we returned to Canada, we decided that traveling best fueled our work and so we looked at our options. Moving to a new country means selling all you have, we have done this countless times (and are tired of it). We had heard of people living on sailboats like SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF9TNM9R-iw'>Lizzy Belle</a> (David Wellsford), SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkaH_UUH0Ek'>Daphne</a> (Terese Carey) and SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYfFeySHGN4DPrOc9So7PA'>Karl</a> (Nike Steiger), and became obssessed with the idea. Lack of experience aside, we thought that being in a mobile studio would help us accomplish our desire to travel while having a stable home.
    & Since then, we have left Canada and have sailed down the american west coast and over to Mexico. After that, we made the big jump across the pacific to French Polynesia, and crossed the wondrous south pacific islands over to New Zealand. We have since left the lower latitudes and sailed up to Fiji (where we are currently) Our goal right now is to make it back to Japan with Pino. We have become true digital nomads, we share our experience in the form of monthly videos; all the while, creating art, tools, books and games.
    & Our goal is to keep moving, while continuing to work on <a href="https://itch.io/c/248074/tools" target="_blank">cool stuff</a>.

SUPPORT
  The first studio on a sailboat
    & The idea of a nomadic design studio, we thought, was the best way to stay creative. Seeing new people and places, enriches our work. We created our two first games (Hiversaires and Oquonie) while in Tokyo and Thailand, and love how those experiences impacted our projects. It is something we want to continue to do, and being in a studio that moves will help us accomplish that.
