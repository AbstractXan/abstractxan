THE RASPBERRY PI
  Introduction
    & The {*Raspberry Pi*} is a small single-board computer that is fairly cheap and easily accessible from anywhere.
    & The {{Pi Computer|Computer}} is currently used only as an experimental development tool aboard {{Pino}}, but could readily be turned into a complete development platform, would our principal computers fail.
    & â€” To quickly setup a new {{Raspberry}} board, see the {{Pi Setup}}.
  Setup
    & Download {{Raspbian Lite|https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/}}. Use {{Etcher|https://etcher.io}} to create the Boot SD card. Once Etcher has finished, re-insert it and type:
