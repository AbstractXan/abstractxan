People on street were falling down and cars were crashing into objects and people one after other. But she couldn\'t see any of it as her vision quickly faded and her head became light. It was the most sad day of the Architect\'s life as her precision matrix was off the grid. The perfect place of humanity was rejected by its inhabitants The Paradise Matrix has fallen.</p><p>16.
