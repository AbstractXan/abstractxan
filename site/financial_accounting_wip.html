Once all transactions with outside entities are recorded for the period, adjusting entries are made to particular accounts- Eg. Prepaid expenses, warehouse building, store fixtures, franchise fee and taxes payable.<br><br>H. <b>Closing Entries</b> : Close out each temporary or income statement account and reset it to a zero balance, in preparation for the next accounting period.

They differ in their presentation of operating cash flows.<br>B. <b>Direct Method</b>: Under the direct method, in the operating section, are included a number of line items, each of which is a cash inflow to the reporting entity or a cash. The direct method statement of operating cash flows can be prepared directly from the entries in the cash T-account during the accounting period. [TBD: Add Sample Format]<br><br>C. <b>Indirect Method</b>: Operating section starts with the net income and make a series of de-accrual adjustments to it in order to derive the net cash from operations.

High/Low bad debt ratio indicates company is failing to properly screen potential clients before offering them credit. It might also mean that the company is pursuing less credit-worthy customers in an attempt to generate sales.<br><ul><li>Bad Debt Ratio = (Bad Debt allowances at the end of the period <b>/</b> Gross receivables at the end of the period) x 100</li></ul><br>G. <b>Day's receivable ratio</b> : Indicates the average number of days necessary for the company to collect its outstanding accounts receivable. Analysts compare a company's days receivables with its industry peers. The slowing of a company's days receivables or a high days receivables compared to its competitors has a negative impact on the firm's liquidity. An increasing days receivable ratio might also be an indication that more of the receivables will become bad debts.<br><ul><li>Days Receivable Ratio = (Net accounts receivable / Total Sales in the period) x number of days in the period</li></ul>Last Updated: 16-14,11-9, 3 Jun 2021<br></main><br><hr/><footer><p><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/'><img src='../media/interface/cc.svg'></a><a href='https://fosstodon.org/web/accounts/222003'><img src='../media/interface/mastodon.svg'></a><a href='https://twitter.com/AbstractXan'><img src='../media/interface/twitter.svg'></a><a href='https://github.com/AbstractXan'><img src='../media/interface/github.svg'></a><a href="hyper://6599978e4f895acfa32f6d185af863135af01df917945d5f12c0517a50ac1e19/"><img src="../media/interface/beaker.svg"></a><a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/#random" target='_blank'><img src="https://webring.xxiivv.com/icon.black.svg"/></a><p>Abstractxan Ⓒ 2021 — BY-NC-SA 4.0</p><p></p><form action='https://tinyletter.com/abstractxan' method='post' target='popupwindow' onsubmit='window.open(\'https://tinyletter.com/abstractxan\', \'popupwindow\', \'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600\');return true'><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' class='email' placeholder='email@address.com' required=''><input type='submit' value='Subscribe' name='subscribe' class='button'></form></p></footer></body></html>
