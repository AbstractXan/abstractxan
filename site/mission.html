We figured that if we made enough to have our basic needs covered, we could gradually dedicate more time onto these passion projects.</p><img src='../media/blog/vberth.jpg'/><p>While we have not yet reached that goal, we have definitely moved closer to it. Our combined revenue of <a href='http://patreon.com/100' target='_blank' class='external'>Patreon</a>, and <a href='http://hundredrabbits.itch.io' target='_blank' class='external'>Itch</a>, now allows us to invest increasingly more time to the creation of original projects such as <a href='http://wiktopher.kokorobot.ca' target='_blank' class='external'>Wiktopher</a>, <a href='http://grimgrains.com' target='_blank' class='external'>Grimgrains</a>, <a href='http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Dotgrid' target='_blank' class='external'>Dotgrid</a>, <a href='http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/left' target='_blank' class='external'>Left</a> and now <a href='http://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca' target='_blank' class='external'>Orca</a>. To the creation of content, we have also allocated time to contributing and maintaining the open source projects of others. Via our travel diaries on YouTube, we're hoping to keep on growing toward that ideal position, where we could afford to release our entire catalog of games and books, for free.</p><p><a href='http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Dotgrid' target='_blank' class='external'>Dotgrid</a>, like <a href='http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Left' target='_blank' class='external'>Left</a>, was originally created to be used internally, but has now grown into something used by thousands of creators. The development of the application was done following the <a href='http://wiki.xxiivv.com/the+bazaar+model' target='_blank' class='external'>Bazaar Model</a>, as opposed to the <a href='http://wiki.xxiivv.com/the+cathedral+model' target='_blank' class='external'>Cathedral Model</a>, in which the source code is developed over the Internet in view of the public. It allowed for a <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Dotgrid/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed' target='_blank' class='external'>conversation</a> to occur between us and other Dotgrid users, seeing how differently each person used the tool revealed new directions toward which we could grow the software, and in return, new ways for us to use it as well.</p><p>Through these exchanges, we've encountered amazing people who've made projects possible, which would not have existed otherwise, and these people have grown into friends and collaborators.</p><p>Our intermitent internet connection makes for unpredictable release patterns, and spotty technical support, but allowing users to fix their issues while we are away, encouraged people to learn, and to help each other, find solutions, and submit revisions for everyone to enjoy.</p><h2 id='energy_usage'>energy usage</h2><p>We create light-weight tools in an attempt at reducing our broader environmental impact.</p><p>The energy required to power tools like X code and Photoshop keeps growing, and the updates are large and incessant — Photoshop has stopped adding worthwhile content since CS6. Heavier software increase energy usage and shorten the lifetime of computers since they require more powerful machines to use them. Greenhouse gas emissions in production are high. This is worrying, because an estimated 130,000 computers ends up in the garbage annually.</p><p>All of our tools work offline and operate on low-power devices. We can keep creating content when off-grid, when our power and connectivity is limited.</p><p>We developed these tools out of necessity, because <a href='tools_ecosystem.html' target='_self' class='local'>our situation required it</a>.</p><hr/></main><footer><p>Never miss an update</p><form action='https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits' method='post' target='popupwindow' onsubmit='window.open('https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true'><input type='email' value='' name='EMAIL' class='email' placeholder='email@address.com' required=''><input type='submit' value='Subscribe' name='subscribe' class='button'></form></footer></body></html>
