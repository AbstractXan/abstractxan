  <title>Hundred Rabbits â€” Mission</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>mission</h1><h2>pages</h2><h3>OPEN SOURCE</h3><p class=''>We created {*Hundred Rabbits*} with the goal of building an audience that could sponsor the creation of high-quality free content, and making it available to those who could otherwise not afford it. We figured that if we made enough to travel and to feed ourselves, we could gradually dedicate more time onto these passion projects.</p><p class=''>While we have not yet reached that goal, we have definitely moved closer to it. Our combined revenue of {{Patreon|http://patreon.com/100}}, and {{Itch|http://hundredrabbits.itch.io}}, now allows us to invest increasingly more time to the creation of original projects such as {{Wiktopher|http://wiktopher.kokorobot.ca}}, {{Grimgrains|http://grimgrains.com}}, {{Dotgrid|http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Dotgrid}}, {{Left|http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/left}} and now {{Orca|http://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca}}. To the creation of content, we have also allocated time to contributing and maintaining the open source projects of others. Via our travel diaries on Youtube, we're hoping to keep on growing toward that ideal position, where we could afford to release our entire catalog of games and books, for free.</p><img src='media/blog/vberth.jpg' class='undefined'/><p class=''>{{Dotgrid|http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Dotgrid}}, like {{Left|http://hundredrabbits.itch.io/Left}}, was originally created to be used internally, but has now grown into something used by thousands of creators. The development of the application was done following the {{Bazaar Model|http://wiki.xxiivv.com/the+bazaar+model}}, as opposed to the {{Cathedral Model|http://wiki.xxiivv.com/the+cathedral+model}}, in which the source code is developed over the Internet in view of the public. It allowed for a {{conversation|https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Dotgrid/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed}} to occur between us and other Dotgrid users, seeing how differently each person used the tool revealed new directions toward which we could grow the software, and in return, new ways for us to use it as well.</p><p class=''>Through these exchanges, we've encountered amazing people who've made tprojects possible, which would not have existed otherwise, and these people have grown into friends and collaborators.</p><p class=''>Our intermitent internet connection makes for unpredictable release patterns, and spotty technical support, but allowing users to fix their issues while we are away, encouraged people to learn, and to help each other, find solutions, and submit revisions for everyone to enjoy.</p>
