<p class=''>It's 8h00 pm on a cold dark winter night, we are outside of Shimizu harbour motoring in circles and waiting for a response from Shimizu Port Control. We've just spent 5 days riding in 30-40 knots winds, the temperature is 5C and our clothes are wet and caked with salt. This passage was a true test of strength, for us and for Pino. We'd planned to go to Wakayama, riding on the back of a passing low with winds from the NE, shifting to the S and then to the SW, but the wind decided to turn earlier making it impossible for us to go east. We found ourselves close-reaching in 40 knot winds, heading straight north. Looking at the weather we could see that it would blow from the W for 3-4 days, so we made a new plan to head to Omae Zaki. We'd read of other sailors taking refuge there in big weather and thought it would be possible to go, but again, the wind kept pushing us further and further east. The next port on our list was Shimizu, tucked in deep into the bay. We were able to point Pino to the cape just past Shimizu, but we weren't sure if again the wind and current would allow us to make some easting.</p><p class=''>At that point both of us were frozen solid. All our clothes was wet, and wave after wave splashed over the boat and into the cockpit, drenching us in the process. The starboard rail was constantly submerged, with the diesel bins threatening to fall overboard. We had 3 reefs in our main, but 5 slides had snapped off (yet again). I wondered when the rest would break. If we lost the use of our main going forward would be impossible. Inside was also chaos. The joker valve of our toilet decided to stop working and so water kept backflowing upward and came to spill on the floor with every wave, the dorads were leaking badly too, can't say I understand how water made it in there. We couldn't stand inside the boat because of the tilt, with the floor wet doing anything inside required much care. There was no safe place to be inside, aside form a settee where we slept. The lee cloth kept us from falling out.</p><p class=''>We were both tired physically and mentally. We had no appetite at all, and drank little too, we were in SParta mode. Both of us were scared we wouldn't make it. What if we couldn't make it to Shimizu? The port of Shimoda was next... but what if the wind didn't allow us to go there either? I imagined us getting pushed further and further east, past Shimoda, past Yokohama... and Tokyo. I wanted to believe we'd make it, but the last few days had been so horrible that it was hard to beleive that things could be good again. This whole sailing to Japan thing was a silly dream wasn't it? Why the hell did we think we could do this, I wondered. Pino, we're so sorry to have put you in this situation, you deserve better.</p><p class=''>We were aiming for the point just east of Shimizu, with the blind hope of somehow being able to make some easting to get some shelter from the waves inside of the bay. The worse was yet to come. Another danger lay ahead, a very busy shipping channel with cargo ships, fishing boats and other large vessels thundering up and down the coast at 10-15 knots. We had to cut through it to get to Shimizu. I swallowed hard, took a look at AIS to see if this was possible. We could see every ship, as well as their speed and if whether or not we were on a collision course. Our AIS alarm started beeping, signalling ships that are dangerously close, and did not stop for many hours. This felt like the scene in Gattaca, when Jerome, who is very myopic, has to cross a busy highway without being able to see. Jerome just jumped into the traffic and somehow made it out alive, that is what it felt like to cross thhat shopping lane. We couldn't believe we'd made it out of there alive. Some cargo ships altered course for us, but not all would, or could do this. Devine was driving, and I stared at the AIS screen, trying to work us through it all, all the while lying to myself saying that everything was going to be okay and counting down to the number of nautical miles to go before we were in the clear.</p>
