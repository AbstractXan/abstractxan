<h3>THE RABBITS</h3>
<p class=''>We are <a href='https://kokorobot.ca' target='_blank' class='external' data-goto=''>Rekka</a> & <a href='https://xxiivv.com' target='_blank' class='external' data-goto=''>Devine</a>, two unlikely sailors.</p><p class=''>Rekka is an illustrator, and writer, admirer of seabirds and purveyor of fungi. Devine is a programmer, artist and musician, a tireless creative, pasta monarch, and fervent believer in open-source content. Together, we created <b>HundredRabbits</b>, our studio on the water.</p><p class=''>We are fueled by plants, and powered by the sun - solar punks yea!</p>

<h3>STORY</h3>
<p class=''>In January 2016, we left the cold of Montreal and moved west to British Columbia, there, we purchased our sailboat <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Pino/blob/master/README.md' target='_blank'>Pino</a>. Keep in mind, we were a pair of city kids with limited outdoor experience, and neither of us had ever stepped onto a sailboat before.</p>

<p class=''>So <a href='index.html#buying+a+sailboat' target='_self' class='local' data-goto='Buying a sailboat'>why a sailboat</a>? In 2012 we moved to Japan, there, we worked on our first games <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/hiversaires' target='_blank' class='external' data-goto=''>Hiversaires</a> and <a href='http://oquonie.100r.co' target='_blank' class='external' data-goto=''>Oquonie</a> (the latter was completed in Thailand). We love how those travel experiences impacted our projects. After we returned to Canada, we decided that traveling best fueled our work and so we looked at our options. Moving to a new country means selling all you have, we have done this countless times (and are tired of it). We had heard of people living on sailboats like SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF9TNM9R-iw'>Lizzy Belle</a> (David Wellsford), SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkaH_UUH0Ek'>Daphne</a> (Terese Carey) and SY <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYfFeySHGN4DPrOc9So7PA'>Karl</a> (Nike Steiger), and became obssessed with the idea. Lack of experience aside, we thought that being in a mobile studio would help us accomplish our desire to travel while having a stable home.</p><p class=''>Since then, we have left Canada and have sailed down the american west coast and over to Mexico. After that, we made the big jump across the pacific to French Polynesia, and crossed the wondrous south pacific islands over to New Zealand. We have since left the lower latitudes and sailed up to Fiji (where we are currently) Our goal right now is to make it back to Japan with Pino. We have become true digital nomads, we share our experience in the form of monthly videos; all the while, creating art, tools, books and games.</p>

<h3>GOAL</h3>
<p class=''>Our goal is to keep moving, while continuing to work on <a href="https://itch.io/c/248074/tools" target="_blank">cool stuff</a>. We document our travels as we go, our aim is to learn as much as we can about <a href='index.html#sailing' target='_self' class='local' data-goto='sailing'>sailing</a>, the world, about <a href='index.html#off+the+grid' target='_self' class='local' data-goto='off the grid'>offgrid living</a>; to have a small ecological footprint, and to share knowledge and have it be available to all.</p>
