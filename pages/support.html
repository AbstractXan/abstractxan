  <h1>support</h1><h2>pages</h2><h3>THE FIRST STUDIO ON A SAILBOAT</h3><p class=''>The idea of a nomadic design studio, we thought, was the best way to stay creative. Seeing new people and places, enriches our work. We created our two first games (Hiversaires and Oquonie) while in Tokyo and Thailand, and love how those experiences impacted our projects. It is something we want to continue to do, and being in a studio that moves will help us accomplish that.</p><p class=''>Want to support our floating studio?</p><ul class='bullet'><li class=''>Use our {{tools|https://itch.io/c/248074/tools}}.</li><li class=''>Play our {{games|https://itch.io/c/264883/games}}.</li><li class=''>Help us {{find & fix bugs|http://github.com/hundredrabbits/}}.</li><li class=''>Sponsor us on {{Patreon|https://patreon.com/100}}.</li></ul><h3>BECOME A PATRON</h3><p class=''><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ" target="_blank">Patreon</a> help fund artists as they produce smaller works like music, art and tools.</p><p class=''>To give a donation, go to our {{Patreon page|https://patreon.com/100}} and click on the <b>Become a patron</b> button.
