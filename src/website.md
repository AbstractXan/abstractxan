## Enigma 2020
### About
![](../media/enigma/poster.png)<p>Enigma is a competitive ciphering and deciphering heist while looking for clues in the gigantic internet universe. Explore some amazing corners of the web-battling out puzzles and reading between the lines. Got stuck on some questions? Work your way out through your search engines. </p>

### Goal
Enigma as a medium is our way of exposing the participants to a myriad of exciting places on the internet. We strive to provide an unparalleled experience similar to an open world game — explore the depths of internet for clues, crack mind-bending puzzles, and get to know more about the rad things people are doing in the world.

Every team's journey is unique and depends on how they approach a problem. Every question has a unique solution and it doesn't matter what path you take, it's important to remember <b>what</b> you're looking for. It's easy to get lost, you see.

### Questions
[Classification of questions](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/457546/LeetCode-Problem-Patterns-from-educative.io)

[Container with most water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) is a brilliant question with an elegant solution that feels like magic. Initial instinct would be to go through the array in O(n^2) time but turns out that it could be brought down to O(n) time and O(1) space complexity. I wish I could classify this problem but I haven't solved these kinda questions enough.
[Reveal cards in increasing order](https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/) is a very good question for testing your knowledge queue implementation.

- docker stop container
- docker ps 
- docker ps -a  (for stopped containers)

## C++ STL
### Vector
[ | | | | =>
- [Fast] Insert at back: <b>O(1)</b>
- [Slow] Insert in beginning or middle: <b>O(n)</b>
- [Slow] Search: <b>O(n)</b> 

- #include &lt;vector&gt
- vector&lt;int&gt vec;
- vec.push_back(5);
- vec.at(0); //Throws range_error exception
- vec.empty(); //<b>bool</b> Check if empty
- vec.size();
- vector&lt;int&gt; vec2(vec); // Copy constructor copies vec into vec2
- vec.clear();
- vec.swap(vec2);
Iterators
- for(vector&lt;int&gt;::<b>iterator</b> itr = vec.begin(); itr!=vec.end(); itr++){
- &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt;  *itr &lt;&lt; endl; // *itr gives value stored
- }
Alternatively for C++11,
- for(auto it:vec) // Use &it for reference, if one wants changes in values
- &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; it &lt;&lt; endl; 

### Deque
<= | | | | =>
- [Fast] Insert at front and back: <b>O(1)</b>
- [Slow] Insert in middle: <b>O(n)</b>
- [Slow] Search: <b>O(n)</b> 
Implementation similar to vector
- #include&lt;deque&gt;
- deque&lt;int&gt; deq = {4,6,7};
- deq.push_front(3);
- deq.push_back(8); 

### List
 [ ] <-> [ ] <-> [ ]
- [Fast] Insert and Remove anywhere: <b>O(1)</b>
- [Slow] Search: <b>O(n)</b> 
Implementation
- #include&lt;list&gt;
- list&lt;int&gt; listt = {5,2,9};
- listt.push_back(2);
- listt.push_front(1);
Find
- list&lt;int&gt;::iterator itr = <b>find</b>(listt.begin(), listt.end(),2); //itr -> 2
Insert
- listt.insert(itr, 8); // Inserts in front of itr
- itr++
- listt.erase(itr)
Splice: Copies elements from list2 (from itr_a to itr_b) to list1 at itr
- list1.splice(itr,list2,itr_a,itr_b);

### Array
Thin layer around the naked array.
- int a[3] = {3,4,5};
- array&lt;int,<b>3</b>&gt; a = {3,4,5}; // Array container of type (int,3)
Limitations
- Size is fixed : array&lt;int,<b>fixed_size</b>&gt;;
- array&lt;int,<b>3</b>&gt; and array&lt;int,<b>4</b>&gt; are different types.
Usage
- a.swap();
- a.size();
- a.begin();
- a.end();

### Set 
- [Slow] Insert <b>O(log(n))</b>
- [Fast] Search <b>O(log(n))</b>

- <b>Non duplicate data
- Value of elements cannot be modified</b>

Do not use sets for simpler problems as insertion takes time and will cause performance issues.

- #include&lt;set&gt;
- set&lt;int&gt; myset;
- myset.insert(2);
- set&lt;int&gt;::iterator it;
- it = myset.<b>find</b>(7);

- pair&lt;set&lt;int&gt;::<b>iterator, bool</b>&gt; ret; // ret.second='false' if already exists
- ret = myset.insert(3);
Insert via <i>hint</i>.
- myset.insert(itr,9);
'itr' is hint. O(log(n)) => O(1). The better the hint, the better the performance.
Erase
- myset.erase(itr);
- myset.erase(7); // By <b>value!</b>  

### Multiset
- [Fast] Search O(log(n))
- [Slow] Traversing
- <b>A set that allows duplicate items
- Value of elements cannot be modified</b>

- multiset&lt;int&gt; myset;
### Map
- [Fast] Find O(log(n))
- <b> No duplicate key
- Keys cannot be modified
- Type of itr: pair&lt;char,int&gt;</b>
Implementation
- map&lt;char,int&gt; mymap;
Insertion
- mymap.insert(pair&lt;char,int&gt;('a',100));
- mymap.insert(make_pair('z',200));
- mymap.insert(itr,pair&lt;char,int&gt;('a',300)); // itr is a hint.

### Multimap
- <b>Allows duplicate keys
- Keys cannot be modified
- Type of itr: pair&lt;char,int&gt;</b>

- (*itr).first = 'd'; // Error

## Casual Discoveries
### Coding

- Sets are slower! Frek my runtime.
- Iterators add overhead? Maybe..
- Inplace algorithms improve space complexity
- WHAT ARE BIT VECTORS UGH

## Experiments with life
### Introduction
Being constantly dissatisfied with myself, I feel very stagnated in life. To come out of these badlands, I'll be writing blogs on my experiments on myself.

### Workouts
A set of body workouts including: Gym workouts, Yoga and Meditation on a daily basis.

### Productiviity
Every work using pomodoro.

Factors that help improve productivity:
- Casual debate with someone
- Cooking
- Drawing
- Getting inspired

Factors that hinder productivity:
- Trying to do a lot of work at once
- Keep sitting at a single place
- Excessive gaming (drains the mind)

### Tracker
Currently, I'm building a personal tracker for productivity and projects. I'll be posting daily progress here until then. Every time slot is broken down into pomodoros i.e 25min.

The people were slowly rejecting the matrix just like her unable to cope up with the reality so perfect. Symptoms were visible from last few weeks and everyone was feeling them. Things were getting progressively bad. She was feeling her vision slowly get blurry. She got up and walked to the balcony. People on street were falling down and cars were crashing into objects and people one after other. But she couldn\'t see any of it as her vision quickly faded and her head became light. It was the most sad day of the Architect\'s life as her precision matrix was off the grid. The perfect place of humanity was rejected by its inhabitants The Paradise Matrix has fallen.</p><p>16.
