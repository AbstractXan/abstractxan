## Object Oriented Programming
### C++ Classes 
- class Box {
- &nbsp;&nbsp;public:
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double length;   // Length of a box
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double breadth;  // Breadth of a box
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double height;   // Height of a box
- };

Creating objects:
- Box Box1;

Accessing data members (dot operator):
- Box1.length

C++ Classes and Objects in detail: [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_classes_objects.htm)

### Inheritence
### Polymorphism
Polymorphism occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance.

C++ polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function. (Overriding)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AbstractXan/0e4f771dca763653cb560f1751a31ead.js"></script>

<b>Virtual Function</b>
This could be fixed by using 'virtual' keyword for the parent function.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/AbstractXan/229f53e877eb1c7ece104a14eccaf3fa.js"></script>

Defining a virtual function for a base class, with another version in a derived class, signals to the compiler that we don't want static linkage for this function. Instead, we want the function to be called at any given point in the program to be based on the kind of object for which it is called. This sort of operation is referred to as <b>dynamic linkage</b>, or late binding.

<b>Pure Virtual Function</b>
Defining virtual function in a base class so that it may be redefined in a derived class to suit the objects of that class, but that there is no meaningful definition you could give for the function in the base class.

- virtual int area() = 0;

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation — private instance variable and public accessor methods.
### Abstraction
Using abstract class/Interface we express the intent of the class rather than the actual implementation.
### Overloading
More than one definition for an operator or a function with different parameters and usage ; used in the same scope.

Function overloading:
- void print(double  f) {
- &nbsp;&nbsp;cout << "Printing float: " << f << endl;
- }
- void print(char* c) {
- &nbsp;&nbsp;cout << "Printing character: " << c << endl;
- }

Operator overloading:
- class Box {
- &nbsp;&nbsp;...
- &nbsp;&nbsp;Box operator+(const Box& b) {
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Box box;
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box.length = this->length + b.length;
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box.breadth = this->breadth + b.breadth;
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box.height = this->height + b.height;
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return box;
- &nbsp;&nbsp;}
- &nbsp;&nbsp;...
- };
- ...
- Box3 = Box1 + Box2;

## Zero Knowledge Proofs
### Introduction
Zero knowledge proof / zero knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (prover) can prove to another party (verifier) that they know 'X' , without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know value 'X'. Properties:
- Completeness
- Soundness
- Zero-Knowledge

## Diffie-Hellmann Key Exchange
### Introduction
- Public key exchange protocol
- [Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n) based cryptography

A and B can agree on a secret key while communicating over a public/insecure network!

### Flavour
Given: <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> want to agree upon a secret colour. Eavesdropper <b>C</b> who is able to intercept their messages.
Assumption: Color seperation is expensive.
- - A and B <i>publically</i> agree on a common colour P.
- - A and B choose some secret <i>colour</i> X and Y respectively.
- - A mixes P+X and sends to B
- - B mixes P+Y and sends to A
- - C intercepts P+x and P+Y
- - A and B then mix their personal secret colours to the received colors.
- - A's new mix = P+Y+X
- - B's new mix = P+X+Y
- - A and B arrive at the same colour
C could not come up with P , X and Y from P+X and P+Y as they are <i>almost</i> inseperable. C is unable to make P+X+Y and thus P+X+Y is now the secure private key for A and B.
<div style="max-width:250px">![Diffie-Hellmann Key Exchange](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Diffie-Hellman_Key_Exchange.svg/800px-Diffie-Hellman_Key_Exchange.svg.png)</div>
- Source:Wikipedia

### Simple cryptographic use case
A and B publicly agree on a prime number <b>p</b> (say 23). A and B then agree on a generator <b>g</b> (say 5) belonging to {1, ... , p-1}. (More on this below)

- - A chooses secret integer a=11 and computes A1 = g^a mod p = 5^13 mod 23 = <b>21</b>
- - B chooses secret integer b=9 and computes B1 = g^b mod p = 5^9 mod 23 = <b>11</b>
- - A and B exchange A1 and B1
- - C intercepts A1=<b>21</b> and B1=<b>11</b>
- - *MAGIC*
- - A performs B1^a mod 23 = 11^13 mod 23 = 17
- - B performs A1^b mod 23 = 21^9 mod 23 = 17
- - Thus A and B could now use this an their encryption key.

This is because (g^a)^b mod p = (g^b)^a mod p
i.e. (g^a mod p)^b mod p =  (g^b mod p)^a mod p
Even though C is aware of prime number p, generator G, A's message A1 and B's message B1; C is unable to generate the new secret key as it is computationally intractable to find secret keys from A1 and B1 i.e. It is hard to figure out x in g^x mod p = A1

But is this secure enough? 

### Discrete Logarithm Problem
Given  p , g ,  g^x mod p , find x. This problem gets really hard for very large prime values of p. Finding the solution in polynomial time is still an [unsolved problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_computer_science#Polynomial_versus_non-polynomial_time_for_specific_algorithmic_problems) in computer science. Thus, the strength of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is the Discrete Logarithm Problem.

Why generators? What do they generate?

### Group
A group is a set with operation under : <i> closure , existence of inverse element , associativity, existence of identity element </i>. For instance, (Z,+) is integer group under addition.

Groups which can be generated by a single element are called <b>cyclic</b> groups. These special elements are called <b> generators</b>.

Example: Consider a dot operation defined as <b>a . b = (a*b) mod n</b> over a simple group G : {1,2,3,4} for n = 5
Also consider the notation that a[i] = ((a . a ). a) ... (i times).
Now, a number g from G will be called a generator if it performs the operation on itself to generate the whole group.

- 1 : 1[i] = ( 1^i mod 5 ) = {1} for any i
- 2 : 2[i] = ( 2^i mod 5 ) = {2,4,3,1} for i=1,2,3,4 respectively = G 
- 3 : 3[i] = ( 3^i mod 5 ) = {3,4,2,1} for i=1,2,3,4 respectively = G
- 4 : 4[i] = ( 4^i mod 5 ) = {4,1} for i=1,2 and so on..

Since, we can generate G from 2 and 3, they are the <i>generators of group (G,dot) </i>. 

Generators have a property that g^i mod p generate a group of numbers between 1 to p-1 and that every number is equally likely to be generated. This group is called [<i>multiplicative group of integers modulo <b>n</b></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n). It is defined as a group of integers coprime to <b>n</b> from the set {0,1,...n-1} under <i>multiplication modulo n</i>. (a . b = (a*b) mod n). Since our p is prime, the generated group includes all numbers from 1 to p-1.

This way, the encryption key could take any value between 1 to p-1 equally likely and thus it is harder to guess for larger values of p.

Such cyclic groups modulo p, a large prime number, and a corresponding generator ([primitive root modulo p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n) ) g are used to create secure public key transfer protocol given that discreet logarithm problem is hard to solve.
### Flaws
Impersonation issues.
### Further

We realise that since we use a <i>large</i> prime p, the encryption key becomes <b>huge</b> as well, as g^ab mod p always lies between 1 to p-1. This proves to be memory extensive.

An interesting area is [Elliptic curve cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAtBM06xwaw) which tends to reduce the encryption key size and provide equivalent security.

### Questions
[Container with most water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) is a brilliant question with an elegant solution that feels like magic. Initial instinct would be to go through the array in O(n^2) time but turns out that it could be brought down to O(n) time and O(1) space complexity. I wish I could classify this problem but I haven't solved these kinda questions enough.
[Reveal cards in increasing order](https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/) is a very good question for testing your knowledge queue implementation.

### Example
Running a Jupyter Tensorflow Notebook Server:
- docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "$PWD":/home/jovyan/work jupyter/tensorflow-notebook:latest
Here, ' -p 888:8888 ' maps the machines 8888 port to containers 8888 port. Also, ' -v &lt;machine_path&gt;:&lt;container_path&gt; ' maps the machines working directory to container's path (usually predefined). Here we map ' $PWD ' i.e current directory's path with container's predefined path '/home/jovyan/work'.

## C++ STL

### Vector
[ | | | | =>
- [Fast] Insert at back: <b>O(1)</b>
- [Slow] Insert in beginning or middle: <b>O(n)</b>
- [Slow] Search: <b>O(n)</b> 

- #include &lt;vector&gt
- vector&lt;int&gt vec;
- vec.push_back(5);
- vec.at(0); //Throws range_error exception
- vec.empty(); //<b>bool</b> Check if empty
- vec.size();
- vector&lt;int&gt; vec2(vec); // Copy constructor copies vec into vec2
- vec.clear();
- vec.swap(vec2);
Iterators
- for(vector&lt;int&gt;::<b>iterator</b> itr = vec.begin(); itr!=vec.end(); itr++){
- &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt;  *itr &lt;&lt; endl; // *itr gives value stored
- }
Alternatively for C++11,
- for(auto it:vec) // Use &it for reference, if one wants changes in values
- &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; it &lt;&lt; endl; 
### Deque
<= | | | | =>
- [Fast] Insert at front and back: <b>O(1)</b>
- [Slow] Insert in middle: <b>O(n)</b>
- [Slow] Search: <b>O(n)</b> 
Implementation similar to vector
- #include&lt;deque&gt;
- deque&lt;int&gt; deq = {4,6,7};
- deq.push_front(3);
- deq.push_back(8); 
### List
 [ ] <-> [ ] <-> [ ]
- [Fast] Insert and Remove anywhere: <b>O(1)</b>
- [Slow] Search: <b>O(n)</b> 
Implementation
- #include&lt;list&gt;
- list&lt;int&gt; listt = {5,2,9};
- listt.push_back(2);
- listt.push_front(1);
Find
- list&lt;int&gt;::iterator itr = <b>find</b>(listt.begin(), listt.end(),2); //itr -> 2
Insert
- listt.insert(itr, 8); // Inserts in front of itr
- itr++
- listt.erase(itr)
Splice: Copies elements from list2 (from itr_a to itr_b) to list1 at itr
- list1.splice(itr,list2,itr_a,itr_b);
### Array
Thin layer around the naked array.
- int a[3] = {3,4,5};
- array&lt;int,<b>3</b>&gt; a = {3,4,5}; // Array container of type (int,3)
Limitations
- Size is fixed : array&lt;int,<b>fixed_size</b>&gt;;
- array&lt;int,<b>3</b>&gt; and array&lt;int,<b>4</b>&gt; are different types.
Usage
- a.swap();
- a.size();
- a.begin();
- a.end();
### Set 
- [Slow] Insert <b>O(log(n))</b>
- [Fast] Search <b>O(log(n))</b>

- <b>Non duplicate data
- Value of elements cannot be modified</b>

Do not use sets for simpler problems as insertion takes time and will cause performance issues.

- #include&lt;set&gt;
- set&lt;int&gt; myset;
- myset.insert(2);
- set&lt;int&gt;::iterator it;
- it = myset.<b>find</b>(7);

- pair&lt;set&lt;int&gt;::<b>iterator, bool</b>&gt; ret; // ret.second='false' if already exists
- ret = myset.insert(3);
Insert via <i>hint</i>.
- myset.insert(itr,9);
'itr' is hint. O(log(n)) => O(1). The better the hint, the better the performance.
Erase
- myset.erase(itr);
- myset.erase(7); // By <b>value!</b>  
### Multiset
- [Fast] Search O(log(n))
- [Slow] Traversing
- <b>A set that allows duplicate items
- Value of elements cannot be modified</b>

- multiset&lt;int&gt; myset;
### Map
- [Fast] Find O(log(n))
- <b> No duplicate key
- Keys cannot be modified
- Type of itr: pair&lt;char,int&gt;</b>
Implementation
- map&lt;char,int&gt; mymap;
Insertion
- mymap.insert(pair&lt;char,int&gt;('a',100));
- mymap.insert(make_pair('z',200));
- mymap.insert(itr,pair&lt;char,int&gt;('a',300)); // itr is a hint.
### Multimap
- <b>Allows duplicate keys
- Keys cannot be modified
- Type of itr: pair&lt;char,int&gt;</b>

- (*itr).first = 'd'; // Error

## Casual Notes
### Coding

- Sets are slower! Frek my runtime.
- Iterators add overhead? Maybe..
- Inplace algorithms improve space complexity
- WHAT ARE BIT VECTORS UGH
- XORing string don't test it unique. T_T


## Experiments with life
### Introduction
Being constantly dissatisfied with myself, I feel very stagnated in life. To come out of these badlands, I'll be writing blogs on my experiments on myself.

### Workouts
A set of body workouts including: Gym workouts, Yoga and Meditation on a daily basis.

### Productivity
Every work using pomodoro.

Factors that help improve productivity:
- 
- Taking breaks between work
- Explaining a concept to someone
- Getting inspired
- Cooking
- Drawing

Factors that hinder productivity:
- Absense of physical activities
- Trying to do a lot of work at once
- Stress
- Prolonged sitting
- Excessive gaming (drains the mind)


### Tracker
Currently, I'm building a personal tracker for productivity and projects. I'll be posting daily progress here until then. Every time slot is broken down into pomodoros i.e 25min.

### Enigma 2: Paradise Falls
<p>In a future far unseen an architect was busy working on a paradise for the whole humanity. It  was a world without suffering, an Utopian society and a prison for minds trapped in the dimension of virtual reality.</p><p>It was a facade build to enslave the minds. It was the matrix.</p><p>It was the first prototype matrix which stimulated the New-York city. Equipped with all the pleasure one can wish for it was just one component away from completion. The matrix was filled with millions of trapped minds. It needed much required order and someone to maintain it for eternal of enslavement of the human race.</p>;

### Chapter 1: The first program
<p>Program of Agent Smith was almost done all it needed was the initiation sequence, hidden in plain sight for everyone to see the sequence was also supposed to be the first sentence of the unstoppable program called Agent Smith.</p><p>1. Enter the initiation sequence [1 point]</p>

### Chapter 2: Et tu, Brute?
<p>Agent Smith received the communication protocol to interact with other programs in the Matrix. Once initiated, his memory was flooded with welcome messages. But one caught his attention the most.</p><p>2. anfuvfivbyngvat [1 point]</p>

### Chapter 3: Browsing the Matrix
<p>Agent Smith scanned the log files in search of the sender. The name of which appeared to be a code.</p><p>3. #FF0000 Panda [2 points]</p>

### Chapter 4: The Company of Myself
<p>A girl turned on her computer inside her \"new\" house in New-York. This new-comer to the matrix was met with a strange message on her PC screen \"#FF0000 Panda  invites you to play the GAME\" well that was a bit weird.</p><p><a href='https://www.kongregate.com/games/2DArray/the-company-of-myself'>kongregate.com/games/2DArray/the-company-of-myself</a></p><p>4. Minimum number of shadows needed in level 19 [3 point]</p><p>5. Minimum number of lever presses by \"Jack\" (the hat man) needed to finish the game. Ignore levers triggered by images [3 point]</p>

### Chapter 5: 2̶0̶4̶8̶ 2084
<p>Adriana felt something she had not felt before in this strange new city of New-York. Next day her screen was ready with another message:</p><ul><li>\"The prime program chooses one to be free, are you worthy?\"</li><li> \"Arjen Anthony Lucassen\"</li><li> \"ITBlueMagma\"</li></ul></p><p>6. r/X ; 'X'=? [5 points]</p><p>Corner case end</p><p>X is the answer but not the correct one.</p><p>7. Vigenére agrees - you know the key. [5 points]</p>

### Chapter 6: The Kombat
<p>8. \"Only person to follow the relative by the marriage whose blood code is 45-26\"[8 points]</p>

### Chapter 7: Intertwined
<p>Adriana progresses further</p><p>9. Part 1: {87.73, -86.18, 83.18} lacieb nag a ram [13 points]</p><p>10. Part 2: Answer to Part 2 = Answer to part 1 + sativum [13 points]</p><p>11. Part 3: Gabriel Picolo's famous series has this character [13 points]</p><p>12. Part 4: If this sentence is true, then Santa Claus exists. Is the answer to this question 'No'? What is common in the above statements. [13 points]</p><p>13. End of Chapter 6: Final hint: u/onionchowder. All above answers point to this. [13 points]</p>

### Chapter 8: The Golden Commandment
<p>Adriana was confused by all the random questions but she was still curious. World around her had always felt odd to her but she could never figure out what was so wrong with this apparently perfect world? What was that little something her world lacked? Her monitor blinked again this time with a link.</p> <p><i>\"<a href='https://youtu.be/i2TMDz05I7k'>https://youtu.be/i2TMDz05I7k</a>\".</i></p><p>\"This is the Golden Question you always had in your heart. So hurry up and get there fast. Before it is destroyed by a certain someone who might reach there before you\".</p><p>14. The first team to crack will be the only one to solve. And this realization made Adriana Shiver [21 points]</p>

### Chapter 9: The Chase Begins
<p>Agent Smith was relieved to finally track down rogue program #FF0000 Panda. He transferred all remains of the #FF0000 Panda to his memory and started looking for the loose ends.</p>

### Chapter 10: The Turing Machine
<p>Eliminating the girl and erasing everything was what Agent Smith desired. He reached her apartment to find her PC on and transmitting a video. It had a unbreakable code as its password but he had an infinite mind at his disposal.</p><p>\"It was the first machine of its kind designed to destroy the old world \"</p><p>\"You Know What BM3? some squares have magical properties\"</p><p>\"hzyoi kbnsw uqbhg ltfsg pyrkz mkldz yap\"</p><p>15. Enter The Password [33 points]</p>

### Epilogue: The Final Sequence
<p>Adriana tuned in a news channel. \"Good people of New-York, don\'t believe the false information spread by some terrorists to harm our great nation. NYPD has made multiple arrests in past couple of weeks regarding the video broadcast by the same terrorist outfit to induce widespread public fear.\" She quickly turned it off and leaned back on her chair.
